0,We were on site so decided to visit
1,We shared a few starters and a main with a couple of cold beers
2,We arrived as the restaurant opened and were told there were only two lobsters left if that was what we fancied
3,"Hopeless...The starters were good, we enjoyed those but when the mains finally arrived over an hour later all were dry and tasteless"
4,"For close to £ 300 pounds you would expect much, much better and I won’t bother again"
5,Enjoy....
6,"I dined here with friends on a Saturday night, restaurant was not crazy busy and we had a wonderful table by the window with an amazing view"
7,This was the only positive point I can say about my dinner experience
8,"It was not the first time for me here, I visited the bar and the restaurant few times and this was very disappointing: we went with the tasting menu and between the first 3 courses we waited a crazy amount of time (30/40 minutes) and we then asked if it was possible to speed up a little bit"
9,"After our request was taken very seriously and we did not even have the time to finish the following course that we have our plate cleared and the new course on the table.The service was bland, not attentive at all"
10,Clearing the table a waitress dropped a fork on my friend’s dress and did not even apologise! She looked at my friend like it was her fault
11,"What is more I mentioned in the booking notes, I called and I sent an email as it was a special birthday celebration and I was reassured that they would have presented a celebration cake at the table"
12,"We had dessert, we had coffe, asked for the bill..."
13,celebration plate never arrived.This is not what you expect when you pay almost £500 for a dinner not even in a Michelin star or anything like that.I won’t be back in the restaurant for sure.
14,"I booked Bokan Christmas dinner because we were staying in the hotel on 25/12/19 and at the time of booking, I spoke to a staff who told me that on Christmas Day the restaurant would serve turkey and Christmas pudding with custard"
15,On Christmas Day I was shocked and upset at the restaurant when I spoke to a waiter and I was told that there was no turkey or Christmas pudding with custard.The waitress gave us a table in the corner facing the window and no one could see our faces only our backs
16,"We received bad customer care, a waiter took our orders he frequently went to other tables and check if other customers were ok and if their food is ok and we were ignored"
17,I had to get out of my seat to go over to speak to a waiter to say that I was not happy with the starter
18,I received the crab starter but it was making me sick so I was given the salmon but it was raw and I was unable to eat this
19,We ordered the main dish cow’s cheek and chips but when this arrived we ate a small piece but it was slimy and was making us sick
20,"We called the waiter and asked him if we could have another main dish and he said, “No because the chef cooked it for us and cannot give us another main dish.” My daughter and I only ate the chips for the main dish"
21,"The waitress recommended The Red Seal cocktail, this was served in a long stem champagne glass and not a cocktail glass and it was very sour"
22,We told the waiter that we did not like it because it was very sour
23,He said he would ask the bar upstairs to make us a sweet cocktail
24,We were given another cocktail in a black African head glass
25,I asked the waiter if he could let me know what the ingredients are and if grapefruit juice was in the cocktail
26,He later returned and said grapefruit juice is not in the cocktail but he does not know the rest of the ingredients because they made it upstairs in the bar
27,The dessert Christmas log with ice cream was ok
28,The bill was presented in an old reading book “The Facemaker”
29,I asked the waiter I have never seen the bill presented in this way
30,He said it is new
31,I rang the reception and spoke to Jerome about the problems we had in the restaurant and that our main meal Cow’s cheek was taken away but we were not offered another main meal and we were starving
32,My daughter is allergic to all nuts so when Jermore offered fish fingers and chips he later rang back to say that the fish fingers contain nuts
33,We told Jerome that we would have the Duck legs with chips
34,We received the Duck legs but it was cold and when we cut inside it was pink
35,We got the chips later
36,I was unable to sleep during the night because the duck was not digesting
37,"On the morning of 26/12/19, we had severe vomiting and diarrhoea"
38,Due to the problems we suffered our Christmas 2019 was ruined
39,I am never returning to this restaurant again.
40,"My husband and I were staying at the Novotel for a couple of days and on our first night, decided to have dinner at Bokan"
41,We were shown to a table and were sat for probably about 15 minutes before our order (drink and food) was taken
42,"Around 40 minutes later, we still hadn’t received our drinks, never mind the food"
43,This was despite a couple who came in after us getting both food and drinks long before us
44,"The waiters kept walking past and looking at the table and could clearly see we didn’t have any drinks yet, but did nothing about it"
45,"It wasn’t until I got the attention of a female member of staff, who looked to be in charge possibly and mentioned it to her that something started to be done"
46,"It was however, an hour, before we even got our drinks and then eventually our food came out"
47,"We were charged a £7.25 service charge, which seemed excessive seeing as it took so long to get anything to eat or drink"
48,"When the food arrived, it was ok but nothing special and certainly not worth the wait"
49,"I wouldn’t recommend this place, we certainly weren’t made to feel very welcome and nothing was offered as an apology for the poor service"
50,
51,"We had really bad service, change of courses took a really long time"
52,"Some of waiters speak English inseparably, so we struggled to understand them sometimes"
53,"One Polish waiter was like from distant village asking us “Are you okay now?”, “you didn’t like the food?” when I didn’t finish it"
54,This kind of level would be acceptable in road cafe in Belarus but not on rooftop restaurant in London
55,
56,We were kept waiting for an hour for a table although we had a reservation and stayed in the hotel
57,"Coco, who appeared to be in charge of table organisation was unapologetic and patronising"
58,There wasn’t enough staff to be attentive and alert
59,"The food was good although the price had raised our expectations, which were not entirely met"
60,"I would give Bokan restaurant a miss, the bar and terrace are great."
61,Absolutely terrible and unfriendly Service at the Bokan
62,Reserved weeks in advance for my birthday dinner and as it was in the middle of summer and 34 degrees our entire party was not let in because I was wearing sandals in the 34 degree summer heat! I have spent a lot of money at this place before and there was many other people wearing sandals in the 34 degree heat
63,They were very unfriendly about it and just told me I have to go; will never go there again!
64,"We had dinner in this restaurant.The view is amazing, we were lucky to have our table at the window.We arrived a little early and we asked for a apero in the rooftop bar! We had to go to our table and got our cocktail and also imediately our food"
65,"We didn’t had the time to enjoy our apero first, and we had enough time, the food was ok"
66,"It looked beautiful, but the Taste was a little less spicy.The waiter asked every time if we wanted more water/wine/dessert/coffee.."
67,friendly but also like he wanted to sell more and more...
68,"I didn’t like the dessert, the chocomouse was very bitter"
69,
70,Appalling service here tonight
71,"A medium steak came well done, sides came almost at the end of the meal, no apology, and the extremely rude manager decided to have a go at the kitchen staff in front of us"
72,A real pity as all my other experiences here have been amazing.
73,"This bar has an amazing view, great cocktails and good bar snacks but the service was awful! We ordered snacks and a bottle of champagne to celebrate a special occasion"
74,After about 40 minutes we asked about our order and several people can around making excuses about a problem with their “system”
75,We asked for the manager - he never came and finally our order arrived with the waitress telling us they could comp our cheese plate ....
76,still no one ever came back to check on us or ask if we had everything! Just terrible service and poor management.
77,"If I could give this place less than 1 star, I would"
78,They completely ruined my New Year's celebration by miss-advertising their venue
79,"We emailed them on Friday 28th December to simply enquire if they had more tickets available (No expectations as we know how busy this night is, and it was lastminute.com)"
80,Failing to respond within 24 hours (which is quite a reasonable expectation for such business) we decided to call instead
81,"Upon speaking to one of their unqualified staff, they advised us that walk-ins will be available all night upon payment of £50 per person at the door"
82,This does not secure any tables which was fine for us as we only wanted to enjoy a drink and watch the fireworks from up high
83,"We were pretty happy with this result! To our surprise, today we receive a response to our email (4 days later - excellent customer service I must say) informing us that they are fully booked for the night, but hope to see us another time"
84,How nice of them! As we live in the area we took it upon ourselves to go there personally today and hoped that this will be somehow resolved as they have provided such bad service
85,"Yet again, we were even more disappointed to see that 1st, the manager who responded to our email was so busy she could not take 5 minutes of her time to talk to us about this"
86,"2nd, 'in their defence' (their words, not mine) the manager works office hours and was not there when we called on the weekend, so I guess misinforming clients should be totally acceptable, especially when it comes to one of the busiest nights of the year when all everyone wants is to celebrate somewhere special"
87,I was shocked to see such bad level of management and customer service from such a nice establishment
88,"I have been to Bokan many times before this, and have personally recommended it to many of my friends as probably the best rooftop bar in London, but I am sorry to say that I will not longer be doing that"
89,"To see a manager who would leave their staff to deal with a problem without facing it professionally, and allow others to take blame for their own poor service"
90,Astonishing
91,Happy New Year Bokan!
92,We celebrated a 50th birthday with 6 people at Bokan
93,"While the food was generally very good and well presented on the plate, the service was absolutely terrible"
94,The staff was not trained and inattentive
95,"When we asked for the cocktail list, it took forever to arrive, and the waiter could not explain the cocktails and had to get another member of the bar staff"
96,The same happened with the wine menu
97,"Likewise, the waiters were unable to explain certain items on the dinner menu, i.e"
98,what they were or how they were prepared
99,Everything took an absolutely extraordinary amount of time to arrive
100,We had endless wait times between courses and long periods with empty drinks
101,"It was very hard to track down the waiters for anything, and we had to physically get up twice to grab one to place an order"
102,"It was exhausting and distracting, bringing the mood down"
103,"We were also not served at the same time, i.e"
104,some of us were sitting in front of their rapidly cooling main course while others hadn't received theirs yet
105,The mashed potatoes that were meant to come with my steak arrived only after I was finished
106,"The same happened to some of our party as well, where side dishes were forgotten or arrived too late"
107,"The food was good, but not outstanding"
108,"The ""petit fours"" that came after dessert, were not what we expected: they included cheap tasting jellied sugar candy and by no means ""petit fours,"" as in “delicate pastry”"
109,I would not recommend the “birthday cake” that we had pre-ordered
110,"It was not a cake in any sense of the word, but a moussey fluffy mass on a hard crust"
111,It was impossible to cut and portion and unpleasant to eat
112,We left it there despite having paid around £50 in advance
113,"I’ve heard the same review from friends who, like us, also live in Canary Wharf around the corner from the restaurant"
114,"We could be regulars, but I’m worried to go back and have the same experience"
115,"This area is in dire need of some outstanding restaurants, and it would be good if Bokan cleaned up their act and invested in better service staff"
116,"The ambience and décor are great, very New York"
117,We just need some New York style waiters
118,"There, you’d get served a 3-course meal and are in and out in 1 hour..."
119,"We spent a girls weekend in London and booked this restaurant as it looked amazing from the photos but we were very disappointed!It was like a marathon, the minute we sat down everything was rushed and we didn't have time to relax or enjoy our food or drinks"
120,We ordered cocktails to start our evening but those didn't arrive until after our starter so we had no drinks with our started
121,We then finally received the cocktails with our main but since we prefered to drink wine with the main we had to chuck down our cocktails and quickly order the wine before we finished our main
122,We felt all so sick after our food because everything was rushed and we had no time to diggest or even enjoy our food.The staff was rude to us as well
123,We asked two people if they could take a photo of us but they both turned us down very rudely because they didn't have time
124,At least they could have said sorry in a friendly tone that they don't have time but they amlost shouted at us for asking the
125,"When we confronted our waiter Florian and told him that everything is too fast and that we're having a bad time he just ignored us and told us yes the service needs to be fast and then he left as he didn't like the confrontation.If your table tells you that they're having a bas time then as a good waitor you should at least try and change things, but he didn't.So we just decided not to take desert and just leave as it was just so horrible.Such a shame because it's such a beautiful place but I guess they didn't want us there ...Carole"
126,"We popped in for a drink - great view but despite sitting at the bar, it took for ever to get served"
127,"When we asked how we could get a drink, a surly and grumpy member of staff (Darina or Davina I think) begrudgingly served us"
128,"When we got the bill, there was a ‘discretionary’ service charge added!Oh yes, and to top it off, when leaving, we were virtually bathed out of the way by"
129,Waitress - no ‘excuse me’ or apology - genuinely shocking and made us ashamed to be British!
130,So the title might be misleading slightly but it is my overall feeling
131,"Let me explain that personally I judge a bar by its Long Island Ice Tea, especially one that charges a service charge even with drinks ordered at the bar...First round OK, but my wife who asked for a double gin and tonic ended up having to get another bottle of tonic"
132,"Sure you will say that you get a lot of gin, but it ruined the experience initially"
133,"Long Island was OK,but not stellar"
134,Then onto the the 2nd
135,"Well, if I had wanted to order Tequila I would have,but I didn't"
136,To say the bar person took it badly is a bit of an understatement
137,"Sure he may have thought he was OK about it, but sadly some of us can read body language, the rolls of the eyes and lip reading the commentary to his friends sat at the bar"
138,There wasn't really much of an improvement on the second try but I was too tired to argue.Overall poor rating based on the experience but the view is great
139,"Poor service, slow, unfriendly and made us feel as if we were an inconvenience"
140,"Food was ok, not special but perfectly fine for a set menu"
141,Glasses were never topped up willingly
142,Only got 4 glasses each in the whole 2 hours
143,Not worth the £50
144,Staff probably mean well but due to poor communication the service is terrible
145,Waited 40mins for just the food menu
146,Then waited 20mins for someone to take order..
147,Waitress had audacity to say we were in the wrong somehow instead of simply apologising
148,Not to be too politically incorrect but employing migrant workers that do not use English as their first language is not always a good idea.
149,"We went for a bottomless prosecco lunch with friends, with the only plus coming from the flowing prosecco"
150,The Niçoise salad came with no tuna
151,"When this was pointed out, a saucer of extremely poorly prepared tuna was slapped down on the table.I ordered a smoked pork starter that was a disgrace"
152,I can’t explain what it was
153,Green tasteless slop with a few saffron sized strands of pork.Three of the party ordered steak but weren’t asked how we’d like it cooked
154,"When it arrived it was dry and again, tasteless"
155,The cheese board consisted of cheap cheese straight out of the fridge.After requesting the service charge be removed from the bill the waitress said she didn’t care why we were dissatisfied.One of the worst meals and service I’ve had at a supposedly ‘fine’ restaurant
156,
157,"First of all the views of London are stunning and I wanted to pop by for a quick glass of wine on a Friday evening to show my friend the wonderful view.After waiting, and waiting at the bar I finally got served after 20 minutes.I ordered two glasses of wine (circa £7.50 each) and was told it was not available and would I like a similar Pinot Noir"
158,I agreed and was charged £25.88 for the privalidge
159,I don't really think that's on and charging 12.5% service for people getting their own drinks is frankly ridiculous.
160,I visited here at the weekend after a day in Canary Wharf
161,Whilst the view is good the novelty wears off quite quickly
162,The staff are so rude and I felt very uncomfortable
163,I didn’t like the vibe so after 30 minutes I left
164,I was really disappointed as I had been looking forward to the rooftop bar but based on my experience at the weekend I won’t be returning
165,Would not touch with a 10 foot pole
166,"Yes, the view is great (assuming you're there on a good day)"
167,But the service was painfully slow (took them 45 mins to get our food out after taking orders) and you could tell the staff would much rather be elsewhere
168,"When the food arrived, it was.."
169,below average
170,Not even average
171,"At least, that was the case for me (I had a fried salmon.."
172,"it seemed like their twist on fish and chips but the flavours were not a good combo, shall we just say)"
173,"Now if you asked my fiance, the response is more like ""the food was horrible"" because he got a terrible case of food poisoning that very evening, after the lunch we had there"
174,We didn't have anything else unusual that day so that lunch at Bokan was the likeliest culprit
175,His food poisoning was so bad he had a fever and missed two whole days of work afterwards
176,Long story short: not worth the pain and never going back again.
177,"Location and venue amazing - 5 stars - but really let down by poor bar service, particularly by one of the staff on this evening who appeared to discriminate against certain customers in favour of others"
178,"He was rude, inept and really tarnished what was a lovely night at a spectacular location"
179,What a shame.
180,"We visited Bokan as part of our stay at the Novotel.The Bar offers stunning views of the city and is modern and has a good atmosphere.We visited the bar for drinks on Saturday night and our main criticism would be that the security staff were very rude indeed.We were told that we could not go up to the roof terrace as it was closed, despite the fact that other couples and individuals were going upstairs.The last orders were around 2330"
181,"A polite and pleasant member of the bar staff approached us and asked if we wanted anything else, but then around half an hour later, the same rude bouncer approached us and abruptly said “Same goes for you guys, we close at 1am and we want you done and out”"
182,Not even an ‘excuse me’
183,"Unfortunately, this individual’s attitude ruined our experience"
184,"He was unnecessarily rude and abrupt.Other than that it was a pleasant bar with good staff, but let down by poor security."
185,Visited as part of office group and service was appalling
186,"Order was taken and laboriously handwritten onto a sheet of paper, then tsrnascripted into the order till"
187,"Bar staff are ""supposed"" to print off order and prepare and then waiting staff relay to table"
188,"Simples?! Except the wrong drinks were transposed, the bar staff didn't bother to print off order, waiting staff didn't bother to check that it had been started on even after a number of queries about delays and the non-alcoholic cocktails were served with alcohol"
189,And that was after a 55 minute wait
190,Next round marginally better - except this time the insisted on alcohol free drink (Tequila Sunrise - without tequila) taook 45 minutes to arrive
191,Lovely venue but a classic case of style over substance
192,Beyond parody
193,"Me and my friend staying at Novotel, heard great reviews on bokan"
194,When me and my friend got to the restaurant ordered our food and drinks
195,We where enjoying the amazing views with the drinks we had ordered but where still waiting for the salmon fish and sweet potato fries and Mac and cheese
196,"After 40min waiting for the food we got our mains, just couldn't believe £17 for two small pieces of salmon and small bucket of fries and my friend got his Mac and cheese which had more courgette than anything and was burnt on the sides, looked like a microwaved meal given to my friend"
197,"Really enjoyed the views but the food overpriced for small portions, i sent an email to complain but have not received any reply"
198,
199,Horrible service!!! I wais waiting for 40 minuets to order one drink when the bar was totally empty...
200,Our order could not have been less complicated
201,3 coffees with soya milk (bcause of allergy)..
202,"At first, it turned out that they just simply forgot to prepare"
203,"When I asked, we had to wait for another 30 mins and then guess what."
204,we got 3 cold coffees with normal milk!!We decided not to give 'Terrible' overall rating because after our (semi-loud) complain to the restaurant manager they re-made the coffees and also made it complimentary.
205,"Overall a poor experience, we were three mates looking for quick dinner before going out"
206,"Arrived at the restaurant on the 38th floor, there was no hostess to be seen for at least 5 minutes and no one had greeted us, so we decided to make our way to the restaurant which is a floor below, once we got there again there was no one to greet us"
207,After wondering around the restaurant a waiter appeared we asked if we could have a table for three
208,His response was you need to go back upstairs to the hostess desk and they will allocate you a table
209,Once we got upstairs there was a lady which didn't seem too happy to see
210,"Anyway she brought us to the table.Once at the table we ordered some wine and main courses, friends ordered a fish I ordered steak medium rare"
211,"Drinks arrived fast and the waitress was very good, however once the main courses arrived steak was cooked well done"
212,"I immediately said it to the waitress however her response was you asked it like this however I will change it, it took some time for my plate to be taken back to the kitchen"
213,"While I was waiting for my steak to be redone my mates were enjoying their cod which they mentioned was very good, while they were eating a team of waiters began breaking down one of the communal tables, while this was happening one of the tables fell to the floor making a load noise and getting all of the restaurant to turn around"
214,This was not an appropriate time to be breaking down tables while the restaurant was still half full
215,"There was no presence of management at all.Once my food was ready I could see it on the counter, with severel people touching it with their fingers to see if it's cooked properly"
216,(the only person touching it should be the chef).Once the food arrived waitress was very sympathetic and apologised for the mistake
217,However no manager checked if it was okay.Once my food arrived my mates were already finished their meal and we're in a rush to go
218,"Also the side of fries that was ordered with the original meal was not changed and was left on the table so once my replacement meal arrived they were already stone cold.Anyway overall poor service, limited menu, however has a lot of potential with the right management."
219,Went here a couple of days ago and has the tasting menu
220,Whilst the drinks were great and the views fabulous the food was disappointing
221,"In one dish, coffee overpowered an over cooked and underwhelming piece of veal"
222,"In another grey dish, truffle dominated a fake celeriac pasta tube"
223,It was almost universally disliked by my party
224,Dessert was a drab affair; some off-the-shelf chocolate three ways
225,"The was only one was for me, and that was towards the exit."
226,"Good afternoon Jeevan, Saturday night ."
227,24 February 
228,"we are a couple, i am Romanian by origin, British national my boyfriend is Saudi Arabian, future husband , we had celebrated our engagement and love "
229,Unfortunately we had a really bad experience from beginning at Bokan Bar 
230,"We came to the bar as we heard is a really good one .1) The location is too out of reach , it means that I have to take in consideration to locate the venue "
231,The transport is not a problem 
232,Anyway this was not the main one reason 
233,"2) The main reason why I do this review is when we got to the mini reception Bokan bar upstairs, we needed to greet the staff not her to greet us "
234,"She finished with the ex client taking care of their coats, etc, then we asked for a table, she was in rush saying i wlll find one for you next to the window"
235,"She went to find something, we were following her as we didnt know what to do, wait at reception or what / she stops at one table and start chit chat with that clients or friends "
236,"She forgot about us or what? we dont meean to be rude, but finally we asked her, excuse me could we have a table please ? the second time"
237,"she got nervous and said oh sorry about it , let me find then she starts moving "
238,"Finally she gave us a table opposite the bar , no view"
239,Then she ignores us again
240,Thats reception girl
241,3) we ordered finally our drinks and we were happy we got the table...
242,till we got water x 3 times and the drinks didn't arrive
243,We asked for the drinks but we felt completely IGNORED We were waiting more than 25 Minutes there 
244,4 ) Finally we decided to leave the place..
245,"no drinks, no customer service, nothing"
246,Most of luxury bars they serve nuts or small snack as beginning free or as from the menu and have been asked by waitress.What is missing ? The Bokan Bar is a very highly recognized Bar in London
247,"You guys are competing with the bars and hotels around you The Pearson Room , Cinnamon restaurant Hilton, Scoff and Banter in Edwardian, etc but I have never had this kind of experience nowhere in such as 4 stars bar and Hotel "
248,"I have stayed in Dubai in Novotel, in Bahrain, and other places but never had this experience in my life"
249,We travel a lot and stay in 5 stars hotels
250,I would really want to come back but the customer service destroyed our evening
251,"And not the last one , we needed to spent time to get a taxi to re arrange our night out in the same time, time , energy, not good night out , money the last .."
252,we lost 
253,I believe to get good customer service you need to have good waitress and waiters who works in team and for the same goal to achieve the highly customer service and make each customer happy in order a business to be run properly
254,if you want keep your clients and business of course 
255,That is a priority
256,very dissapointing
257,Is not the first time we are going to the bar at Novotel Canary Wharf
258,"The location and views are amazing, but the service we always find is rude and very inefficient"
259,"They seem not happy with their job, always in rush and they have no time even for say hello when you are arriving to the place"
260,"We want to have some drinks and food around canary wharf area, apparently Bokan is the highest bar/restaurant within the area so we decided to check it out.It takes 20 minutes for the staff to come to the table saying a ""Hi"" and take orders..The whole atmosphere with the service we felt no difference than going to weatherspoon or other pubs"
261,"The food was ok, takes ages to wait for our drinks"
262,No waiter or waitress come to ask if we need another drink
263,Someone finally came to clear the table after the empty plates on the table for quite long time..We decided to leave and we have to walk to the bar to ask for the bill
264,"And we paid the bill with the full service charge while we didn't felt it was worth it.Anyway, will not recommend it to any of our clients or friends."
265,"Nice view, good food, but extremely loud due to dinner party in the restaurant"
266,"At times, it was impossible to understand the people sitting in front of you"
267,"Very unfortunate, were looking forward to a nice dinner."
268,"Fantastic views from the top floor of Novotel Canary wharf, looking back towards the centre of London"
269,"Ordered 2 drinks, cider and one of their cocktails, plus chips to snack"
270,Drinks and mayonnaise/tomato sauce arrived promptly
271,"Had our drinks, no sign of chips, waited and waited, the waitress came over to take away empty drinks, said haven't you got your chips .."
272,no ..
273,"she went away, and they arrived soon after, so obviously forgotten about"
274,Bill came to £26 so expensive for 2 drinks and chips.
275,I was taken there for my birthday
276,"The restaurant was full until 9pm, and so we had to settle for the bar"
277,"The place was very dark, and finding the table was not the say (for me, anyway)"
278,"The awful din emitted by a woman squealing into a microphone (they tell me that it is singing; but it has nothing in common with Covent Garden) was so loud because, apparently, it has to carry over three floors in the building"
279,The occasional breaks which she and her organ grinders took were the best bit - I could hear what was being said to me.I was not impressed by the requirement to hand over my bank card before an order could be taken
280,"What might have been done with it while it was out of my sight was a concern, although it seems to have been all right"
281,"Clearly, this Novotel has had more than its share of dodgy customers, although how they could escape easily from the 38th floor was a mystery to me.I was assured that the food in the restaurant is better than what is available in the bar"
282,This view was shared by our waiter
283,"In my view, the meal was significantly overpricedThe views across London were certainly breathtaking but, apart from the wonderful company I was in, these were the best part of the evening"
284,If I could get into the restaurant itself on a quiet night (i.e
285,"no squealing) I might try it again, but otherwise, for me, it lies between the very disappointing and a ripoff"
286,We booked Bokan as we had visited previously and thought the place had a wow factor
287,We had our nephew and niece visiting from Switzerland and wanted to share a special evening with them
288,The evening was ruined by the woman at the front desk (Julia?) who is quite frankly the rudest person we have ever had the misfortune to encounter in any restaurant
289,Despite having received an email confirming our booking she kept us standing in the corridor for 10 mins and kept insisting that we did not have a booking!! I even showed her the email
290,She was disingenuous and disinterested
291,In the end I asked to see her booking screen and was able to locate the booking immediately
292,She had no sense of how much embarrassment and upset she was causing to us all
293,She didn’t even apologise for her error
294,Atrocious level of service from her
295,
296,I've stayed here 3 times on business
297,Each time I have taken breakfast early (served from 06:30 during weekdays)
298,"Each time the English breakfast items are cold, at best tepid"
299,"I can imagine the chef starts cooking everything around 05:00 to be ready for 06:30, then places the serving dishes under an infra red light arrangement to keep it warm"
300,"Trouble is, it doesn't work! Nothing worse than a cold clammy sausage and cold baked beans"
301,"Only thing I ate at a decent temperature was a fried egg, coz the chef cooked it while I waited!Come on Novotel, find a better solution!"
302,"While there is no doubt Bokan is a well thought out, impressive bar & restaurant, it seems the emphasis is on the initial wow factor and stops there"
303,"The service leaves a lot to be desired.We visited on a Friday afternoon, the venue was not overly busy, maybe around 30 customers"
304,"After taking a seat, we waited for someone to take our order and kept waiting"
305,"Eventually we gave up and attempted ordering at the bar, but we were completely ignored by the staff"
306,"After returning to the table we were finally able to place an order, 40 minutes after arriving.There seemed to be one bar man with responsibility for making drinks, meaning we waited a further 20 minutes on our drinks coming.We decided to order another round, and this time we're helped by a very friendly and helpful member of staff who was happy to answer our questions regarding the drinks list"
307,"The list looks great and you are really spoiled for choice.A separate member of staff then came back to us informing that two out of the three ingredients from our Negronis were not available.Bokan is not short of staff, with around 8 staff on the floor at the time of our visit"
308,"However they were not not overly interested in serving us with a couple leant over the bar on their phones for the duration of our visit.This bar has the potential to be one of the best in the area, with fantastic views over London"
309,But it is hugely let down by lack of service.
310,We booked a table for 9 people at this venue backed by the mighty Novotel brand
311,I mentioned on a telephone conversation the reason for the booking (birthday celebration for my wife and other friends) and that we were bringing a cake
312,The person on the phone didn’t make any reference to any “policy” regarding this.On arrival we were first treated quite rudely because we were 15 min late
313,They lied to me in saying that they called me to see if we were coming and that because they couldn’t talk to me they cancelled my reservation
314,"However, after a while, they “magnanimously found a table for us”"
315,"When we arrived to the table, we were told that they were going to charge us ridiculous 5GBP per person for having a cake of our own"
316,"We said that we were willing to consume on drinks much more than that ridiculous amount which would not even equate to the price of a bottle of Champagne, and we were willing to consume several of those"
317,"The staff was totally unhelpful and unwilling to compromise to avoid ruining our celebrations, even after speaking to “the manager”, who we suspect wasn’t the real manager.Because there is plenty of venues in Canary Wharf, we simply decided to leave and have our cake and plenty of drinks somewhere else"
318,All I can say is that a view is nothing if you have such an appealing behaviour to your customers.
319,Have been here twice just for coffee but the level of service has been appalling both times
320,"First outing it took ages for someone to come to our table , though the place was quite"
321,When the coffees came they were tepid at best
322,Next time I tried to order 2 coffees at the bar from one of waiters but he seemed to just look at me as if it was beyond him and pointed to his colleague saying he would make then and then just walked off without telling his colleague
323,Then I waited and waited and nothing so I gave up
324,That's a just a coffee God knows what happens when you have a meal there I hate to think....
325,
326,"Yes the views are amazing, yes the cocktails are good but these mean nothing if the service does not live up to the expectations"
327,Their booking policy for the terrace appears to be simply untruthful and misleading
328,It's understandable that during good weather it will be busy
329,What is unacceptable is when you ask them to book they say that the system is blocked
330,Even if you say that you will call later they say that you cannot book and that you will have to walk in early
331,"You walk in early and surprise surprise, everything is already booked for the day! So basically they will not tell you that they are fully booked and you're lured in by the hope that there will be availability"
332,This might seem like a small detail to some but the lack of decency and honesty are definitely things that will stop me from going to this place again.
333,We paid two visits to bokan on Saturday first around 7:30pm where we were directed to the bar on the top floor this was fine and the barman prepared two rounds of three drinks as my brother came to meet us before we headed out for a meal
334,"The cocktails were good and the service was too however when we walked over to the roof terrace to take in the views where no one was sat because of the incremental weather it felt like the security had joined our party, on taking a picture on my phone of the skyline I turned and almost bumped into one of them who was so close behind me.We sat on a dry table to finish up our drinks whilst being stared at and by that time was ready to go.We went for our meal and returned around eleven.This time we were greated well and politely taken to a table on the lower level the guy was very nice and explained that if a booked table wasn't claimed in the next ten minutes we could have that as it had better views.We chose a cocktail each this time just the two of us and I went to the bar.The whole ambience of the place had changed staff felt very cold and unwelcoming and stressed"
335,We had another round and headed up to see the now darkened skyline where we were actually followed up the stairs out onto the terrace
336,To add to this upon looking at my receipts I have been overcharged on three of the four rounds and a service charge added even though I went to the bar for every drink.I am in no way a penny pincher but why have I been overcharged and what service am I paying for? There didn't seem to be any chance of a waitered service in the bar.I stayed at the hotel and the room was excellent.
337,"Recently I've discovered this place and decided to bring different friends to have drinks here and spend some time together over a nice prosecco glass!This place is split on 2 floors of which both have an internal part, with just the top floor having also a roof terrace"
338,It's at the 48th floor
339,"The majority of the internal design is made of wood and pastel fabric, with big cushions, chairs, and a stunning view! Literally you can see all of London!! I have the feeling of being in a winter cottage in the Alps, but with the view of being in a modern side of New York! I absolutely love it"
340,"The restrooms are also very nice and clean, and while washing your hands you still have the opportunity of looking outside and admire the view- yes from the restroom! A Big, enormous glass will give you this!The only downside that I've found every time I visited this place and spent money from the Bar, that I'm starting to be seriously annoyed by it - is that when you sit down even before you ask for drinks, they say ""you can be here just for 1 hour"" even when there is no message on the table saying ""reserved!"""
341,"The best part is that after one hour NO one comes to tell you ""hey you need to move!"""
342,Honestly they just need to try and tell me that - they would have no idea of how I would react
343,"I find pretty frustrating that in a rich and expensive place like this, they could have the authority to make me move because someone else needs to sit! If the manager reads this - I have enough money to stay there for hours and hours to drink and eat and I would like to be treated with the respect I deserve as a paying customer!! I really like this place, but the service and attitude I've received every time I visited this place, is disappointing"
344,Please improve
345,Value on the view: 10/10Value of the service: not applicableGeneral value: 7/10 
346,"Went for a friends birthday, and the surroundings, ambiance, and stunning views of London seemed like the ideal scene to have some drinks and celebrate"
347,"There were only 3 of us, and the staff seem friendly, the drinks kept coming, and we was having a great time"
348,"My friend accidentally knocked a drink over, and within 2 minutes the manager came over and said that security was watching us and to calm down"
349,(Knocking the drink over may have been coincidence)
350,"We were having a great time before this and would have easily stayed in there until closing, and spent a lot more money, but this made us want to leave straight away"
351,"The gentlemen could have come over to make sure we was good if he had a concern, or seen if we needed anything, but it felt like because security said something to him, he came over as the man, and told us to calm down"
352,It put us off and I don't think we will be going back
353,"There are enough rooftop bars in London, which are cheaper as well, and you won't get accused of anything either"
354,How one person can ruin a night!!!! 
355,Stayed at the Novotel with my family for three nights
356,Visited Bokan on the Friday night and it's clearly a popular venue for the beautiful people
357,"However, on our last night I asked reception if it was ok to take my son up to the bar to see the London skyline, as it's spectacular"
358,No problem he said.We went up to the 38th floor to be met by a young woman behind the desk who said if reception said it was fine to let a 12 year old in then it was fine
359,Juan behind the bar had other ideas
360,"He said he weren't welcome and despite the place being empty, it was a condition of their licensing laws"
361,"First time I've been refused two glasses of Sprite in a hotel bar! So, back down to the reception where the chap who said it was fine apologised profusely"
362,Apparently if my son had been 13 rather than 12 it would have been fine
363,I lodged a complaint as I've never been humiliated like it by a hotel bar in my life
364,Another more sympathetic member staff agreed that it was outrageous
365,On the Friday night I was in it there does seem to be a thread common in other reviews
366,"Staff are unnecessarily rude and customers (including hotel guests,) are treated like we are lucky to be there"
367,Skyline is spectacular but if you want to be treated like a human being try AquaShard
368,A horrible experience and one that really took the shine off a wonderful hotel
369,
370,The staff are incredibly rude and make the prices up as they go along
371,"Avoid, it's not as good as the staff think they they are.....We were there last night and the entire staff force were some of the rudest people we have ever had the misfortune to be ""served"" by"
372,At the door the front of house had the snottiness attitude and was not the least bit welcoming
373,The bar staff had unwarranted attitude and were argumentative at every opportunity irrespective of the amount of money we were spending
374,"They had the utter nerve to keep changing the prices of our drinks because the menus were in the ""process of being updated""! Here's a tip, update the menus and THEN put them on the tables! Don't tell your staff to come up with rough numbers and then get aggressive when we state our basic consumer rights..."
375,Unfortunately we have to return here in a few weeks for a corporate event
376,We'll be passing this review to our events team Monday in case there's the possibility of moving to another venue.
377,This place is beautiful but it's a total rip off
378,Firstly the lady on the door didn't want us in the bar
379,We turned up early as booking an area for 2 hours was £600! She said if we could find a table then we could sit at it but she didn't like the idea of 20 people and not sure why as we all have jobs and money! It took a man in our party to get a table for us and then she gave me dirty looks all night
380,The last straw was the prices advertised on the menu were not what we were charged
381,"The prosecco was £10 more! Also they add 20% to your bill when you buy from the bar! Surely this is not legal! We have a company party there in 2 weeks time, I will be very rude when I go back because the staff are up themselves big time!"
382,The bar lounge on level 39 has really lovely panoramic views
383,"Unfortunetly, the service is dreadful"
384,I have never come across such rude staff anywhere in London
385,My colleague's birthday drinks were totally ruined
386,The hostess on level 38 was abrupt with no customer skills
387,I was made feel unwelcome
388,Bar staff on level 39 were even worse
389,On several occasions when trying to buy a drink I was totally ignored
390,After waiting for some time I was told I had to queue somewhere else
391,No further details were given or explained to me
392,Buying a drink each time was such a challenge
393,Settling payments was another issue - each time different prices were applied for the same drink
394,"A tall waiter kept coming to our area throughout the night reminding us how we should have booked a table, despite half of the reserved ones being empty"
395,I don't understand why would you want to turn spending clients away when the place is half empty
396,The overall experience was very disappointing
397,"As an employee based in Canary Wharf, I was very excited about the opening of this venue"
398,"I thought it would be great for team outings, Friday drinks, leaving parties, etc"
399,There is no way I'm coming backing to Bokan and will not recommend to it to anyone in Canary Wharf
400,"When you charge premium prices for food, drinks and service, you just have to do better than my last night's experience."
401,Such a shame that what could be a great venue is totally ruined by the attitude of the staff- This included adding unjustified charges and being offensively rude
402,One to avoid
403,What an awful place
404,"The staff were hopeless, took forever to take our order and serve us"
405,"To top it off, they actually ruined my birthday surprise that was arranged for me by my friend"
406,They did this twice by asking him if I wanted dessert or should they bring the cake out!!! Talk about incompetence
407,Yet they wanted a form filling in prior to attending which was done in great detail
408,Clearly they don't communicate with each other
409,Now they are ignoring our email complaint which has been outstanding for 2 weeks
410,Avoid it and go elsewhere.
411,Myself and my girlfriend have eaten at the restaurant a few times and also regular users of the bar and we have even booked New Year's Eve there
412,We decided to take two friends of ours for a drink for the first and although we didn't make a reservation we went upon arriving we was told all the tables are full which we accepted and went to have a drink at the bar whilst waiting for our drinks someone left and a table become available which we sat down to enjoy the bottle of wine and also cocktails we ordered
413,We was then approached by Julia who should not be working front of house and rudely said you cannot sit there even though there was no one else to take the table at the time truly disgusted with her attitude and really had put he of going to what is in theory my local bar I suggest Mondrian at London Bridge there rumpus room bar is a lot more better run with friendly staff.
414,I visited Bokan on Friday night for a few drinks in your rooftop bar (39) with a few friends for one of their Birthdays
415,We were always going out after but really wanted to visit this place as it has of course recently opened and looked amazing
416,"When we arrived we were a little early so fully understandable that the table wasn’t ready but saying that, I called a good 30 mins before we was going to arrive and whoever answered the phone said the table was already ready"
417,We stood there awkwardly in everyone’s way by the entrance for a good 10 minutes waiting for someone to simply wipe down the table and clear the glasses so we could take a seat
418,"As we finally got taken over to the table 3 of the 5 of us take a seat and 2 of us left standing as there was only 3 chairs when the booking was for 5! As your waiter frantically panicked looking for 2 chairs, lucky another table offered us their 2 stools as your waiter came back saying he couldn’t find any"
419,By now you can imagine I wanted to just get up and leave due to the shambles going on around me
420,"Couldn’t get a table with enough chairs, could just about get my table and everyone seemed a little too busy to listen to what I was saying or to help"
421,Seemed a little under staffed to me.Finally we are at the table and 15 minutes later we get given the menu so we can order a drink
422,"After waiting another 20 mins for her to come back and take our order, we sat there patiently and waited for our drinks"
423,By now I wondered if they were ever going to turn up but eventually they did
424,"I didn’t think it took that long to make a drink, we didn’t even order food! Again, must have been understaffed as it wasn’t particularly busy but all we have done so far is wait"
425,Extremely inattentive.The drinks finally arrive! I have ordered my favourite cocktail (that isn’t even on the menu) a Pornstar Martini
426,"At first glance is looked amazing and by now I was so thirsty I was ready to drink it in 1! I sat there and thought, this is going to be so good and make up for the experience we have had so far, but…"
427,It was rancid
428,"I don’t know if your bar staff have ever had a pornstar martini anywhere else but I have never had such a sour tasting, dry, small pornstar martini in my life"
429,"Even the prosecco on the side was again, extremely dry and sour to the taste"
430,"I would never order a Pornstar Martini from here ever again, even worse that one I have had from the likes of Be At One or All Bar One and this is supposed to be an amazing rooftop bar competing with the likes of Radio Rooftop and Rumpus Rooms and it was just not even comparable"
431,"Id compare it from my experience so far to my local Weather Spoons.Right, ive had enough, we are leaving, attic bar is around the corner and ive been there before and know it is a safe bet"
432,This is me trying to salvage what dignity I have left as I have recommended this to everyone and booked it for a friends Birthday and it was just a shambles
433,"Trying my best to keep spirits high as everyone looks like they have just had enough and want to go home.I manage to finally get hold of someone to get my bill as no one is giving eye contact so unless you chase after them, you are out of luck"
434,"I hand over this little business card that you get free at the front with a little number on it to get my card back (cant even supply the plastic tabs) and 10 minutes later get my card, and guess what? The completely wrong receipt.You literally managed to give me my card back with someone’s else’s receipt order"
435,"You can imagine how this looks, you could have given my card to the right person or if I hadn’t have checked it, I would have paid nearly a £300 bill for my 5 drink order.I flag this up immediately to get my correct receipt"
436,With this one I ask politely to take the service charge off my receipt as I refuse to pay 12.5% for what was terrible service
437,Your waiter comes back with yet another receipt
438,This time it is our order but there appears to be an extra bottle of Rose wine on there! Again not what I ordered
439,"Like how bloody hard isit to print a receipt out of what we ordered on our tab with our table number? Obviously very difficult.This isn’t the end though, here comes the embarrassing bit your end"
440,"When she (the original guy was obviously too embarrassed to come over) comes over to take the payment she asks ‘Why do you not want to pay the service’, I hate to say it as I am not a rude person, but I laughed in her face, I said you cant prepare a table with 5 chairs, cant put correct orders onto a receipt and im surprised I even got my bank card back"
441,And you want me to pay you for this? She stood there stunned and said ‘the company make us ask’
442,If this is true then you should be ashamed of yourselves
443,You charge good money for drinks alone but then expecting me to pay the extra 12.5% for the worst service I have ever received
444,I have received better service ordering a Bic Mac at 4am
445,"It is up to the people paying if they want to pay service charge, hence why it is optional"
446,"To make your staff ask as to why is horrendous, everyone was looking at them and to think that is going to put me on the spot like it would most people, you are very wrong"
447,"I raised my voice and explained exactly why as your other customers listened in, in shock.I don’t know if this was just a bad experience I had or if this is just what to expect from this place"
448,"Big name, great advertising, well set up with amazing views and good money spent on the interior! But as to the service, staff and drinks, unless I see a lot of good reviews go in soon, I don’t think I will be going back or recommending this to any one I know"
449,This just really lowered the mood and pretty much ruined our night when it was supposed to be the highlight!I hope your service will improve so no one else experiences what I did on Friday night.
450,Great venue
451,Brilliant view and really well designed menu....Then the service comes in to play
452,The waitress didn't understand English
453,The food took ages
454,The bottled beers were warmish and the overal experience despite the positives above were marred by the simple fact that the service was third rate.Please tell me why restaurants don't train their staff properly? Or perhaps they are trying to do it on the cheap but with main courses nudging 30 pounds and plenty of pass through clientele they done really need to care I suppose
455,I can't recommend this place
456,Extremely disappointing
457,"Will not be returning or recommending to others.We booked this restaurant for a special occasion, a birthday meal for my boyfriend"
458,"Initially the doorman to the hotel at the entrance tried to turn my boyfriend away despite the fact he was wearing a shirt and trousers, he was also wearing white converse and therefore 'trainers'"
459,"As we were not informed there was a dress code upon booking a table, I have suspicions this could have been because another reason such as his race and nothing to do with what he was wearing"
460,I did look on the website post our visit under their policy section to describe the dress code as .....'Smart casual
461,"No athletic sportswear and shoes, no flip flops, no beach wear"
462,Denim is acceptable
463,The team reserves the right to deny entrance should a guest’s attire and overall presentation not adhere to our dress code.' After making it up to the floor of the restaurant we were then told that as we were now 10 minutes late and therefore could no longer seat us at a table
464,Instead we were told we could have a seat at the bar if we wished
465,"However, as the restaurant was not even half full this seemed unreasonable why staff flat out refused to seat us at a table for lunch"
466,"Needless to say we swiftly left and instead dined at The Big Easy, a few minutes away on the DLR"
467,I suggest that the policy on dress code as well as the cut off for on a booking is explicitly made clear when booking a table so others do not also waste their time.We will not be trekking halfway across London to this establishment again
468,Dreadful.
469,"It is the second time we have visited the Bokan 38, and although the food is amazing, the service once again was very poor.The hostess welcoming us was quite abrupt (on 38, not ground floor), and for the duration of our lunch didn't spare a smile.Our waitress was lovely and smiling, but didn't follow through the lunch: ie after our food was brought (by other people), she reappeared when we were finished to ask if everything was ok"
470,"My husband explained that although the food was excellent, no as I had to go to the bar to ask for cutlery, salt&pepper, and sauce, that half of my club sandwich was cold, and the burgers were just warm"
471,"So she proceeded in telling us that if we wanted a dessert , that would be on the house However, we never saw the menu"
472,"We had asked a second round of drinks to the young lady who served us the food, and not being a waitress, she went to the bar to ask someone to come to the table to take the order...it never happened! I had to go to the bar to check on the order to be told that they didn't have it, to go back to the table that someone would be there shortly.....We had the second round after finishing the food"
473,"Long...too long.However, when we asked for the bill, it comes very quickly with the card machine.What can I say, the view is breath taking and the concept is great, but most of the staff there should have a thorough reminder of what pro-activity and customer service are."
474,After my last dismissal attempt to make a booking i decided to visit unannounced to this well reviewed restaurant
475,It has a number of good reviews but i cannot see why at all
476,"On arrival at the Novotel reception we were greeted by 5 members of staff all carrying IPads wow you may say? they directed us to the bar, but i could not see the reason for their presence as they didn't speak to us we spoke to them, very odd.On exiting the lift to the restaurant area we were met again by a very pretty young female maitre d, thats were that ends, she was confused and couldn't understand why we were there?We left the foyer and approached the bar were by we noticed behind the bar, 2 males picking leaves for garnish, 1 female waitress drinking a glass of wine and another constantly walking around making no eye contact or serving customers, strange we thought in a bar? how do they make money you may well ask.After waiting almost 10 minutes and not being acknowledged, we left and returned to the foyer area"
477,"I approached one of the same five greeters as we entered, and informed her of the extraordinary poor service we received, she apologized turned and carried on talking to the remaining 4 staff, i would love to meet the fool who employed this bunch!!"
478,"As an employer myself, i was horrified to witness such poor customer skills and attitude to customers needs such as food and beverage, thats sarcasm!!, its obvious its not their money at stake, whilst the restaurant has good reviews this is our second time to this cheap rate hotel, this has certainly been reflected in our 2 visits, would i venture there again, no! i live here in Canary Wharf but would not recommend this restaurant or bar"
479,"Whilst tourists may stray unwittingly in, locals beware, its not good, for those who think its good value try Roka, Carluccio's, The Parlour, Plateau or The Manhattan Grill to name just 5 for those of you wishing something big and brash try Big Easy those of you who crave a view, try Nelsons column"
480,I arrived at the restaurant to be told it was closed which was understandable given the 10pm time but was informed that bar snacks were still available
481,I asked for a drink and a club sandwich at the bar and was told to take a seat and someone would take my order.After thirty minutes a waitress noticed I'd been waiting and asked if I would like a glass of water (with a club sandwich please!!) she apologized for not noticing I was there (6 feet 1 and 16 stone) I took the glass of water and she disappeared again.Thirty five minutes without a drink or food order - unfortunate as it seemed to be a great place with a nice atmosphere.
482,"The venue is great, and worth a trip for the view alone, but do not stay to eat or even drink"
483,"It took us half an hour to be seated, with staff ignoring us, and palming us off to other disinterested staff members"
484,"We eventually ordered a bottle of prosecco, which took 45 mins to arrive and 2 trips to ask why it was taking so long"
485,"We ordered a cheese platter to start, and waited almost an hour and half for this to arrive"
486,"We were however given a plate of calamari by way of apology, but we noticed that the only reason for this, was because they had ordered it by mistake, and didn't know what to do with it"
487,The cheese board eventually arrived and was very uninspiring - not worth £20!We decided to go and eat elsewhere as the whole experience was a bit of a joke
488,"We noticed we weren't the only table complaining, as wrong orders were being delivered and people were waiting ages for drinks"
489,The mandatory 12.5% service charge really topped it off
490,Bokan does have a beautiful view of london and very well decorated inside
491,"However, we attended in a large group where we were told we had to order from a set menu"
492,"What was very odd, choices were very limited and cheaper to buy off the a la carte menu"
493,"Portions were very small (agree gourmet food has smaller portions but this was smaller than dishes served at the Dorchester, Oblix etc) and whilst they were presented well, the food was below average vs"
494,similar restaurants and somewhat bland
495,"Service was awful, food was served cold so some dishes were sent back and drinks took forever to serve"
496,We ended up getting up to order from the bar itself
497,If I go back it would only be for drinks and the view
498,"Got to Bokan, 38th floor as we had a drinks table reservation"
499,"Upon reaching they advised it's no problem and to follow the host, to quickly estalishing that they didn't have any tables so we were asked to wait around by a confused hostess ."
500,Initially requesting us to sit in the most empty space with no padded seating even though we'd had a reservation
501,Soon after a hostess places us amongst a group of others
502,The service was that slow that my husband ended up going to the bar himself which again was a completely disorganised
503,"Whilst he was getting the drinks, I was asked to move as the table I was told to sit at was also booked"
504,"At this point, I was pretty mad and my husband and I left shortly after our first drink"
505,Wouldn't return and they really need to sort their booking system / customer service out! I'd dread to think what the restaurant would be like!!
506,The problems started from the moment we stepped in
507,I made a reservation well in advance with request for a window table
508,Instead of that on arrival I was told that we have table allocated at the bar !! After 10-15 minutes of pretended rush by the stuff they found a table not any near the windows
509,probably worth mentioning that there were at least 3 tables available by the windows at the time we enter and left !! We ordered drinks at the bar as we had to wait the team to sort the mistake with the reservation and we got the order wrong twice
510,Not to mention that one person joined minutes later and no one even bother came around to get te drink order.The restaurant food was just OK for the price you pay
511,However it was not explicit that all mains come without any sides and we were not promoted by the waiter to order side
512,It took 45 minutes for the mains to arrive and only then we realise that they don't come with sides hence we needs up eating without any
513,Also it was greatly disappointing to see that they added 12.5% service charge which is not discretionary as I have noticed they claim to be in other reviews
514,For the service I received I would not have bothered paying any tip but they have made sure thy get what they want by the mandatory service charge
515,Also they have to think about te dress code for this place if they don't want to turn it to Local Nando's - quite a few people were dressed not so appropriately for this type of establishment - to put it into perspective it is not very pleasant to see some customers with low hanging jeans and revealed bottoms .Overall it is worth no more than an overpriced observation deck
516,Perhaps the Hal price offer at the begging might have attracted the wrong crowd and established this venue as mediocre
517,
518,We visited on Friday 17th March and that will probably be the last time
519,We arrived happy
520,Full of joy
521,"It was Friday, St Patrick's day"
522,Spring is not far away and all was right in the world
523,Now the concept is great and the decor in keeping with the name and the appeal of this bar and restaurant
524,And as for the view - fantastic! Wonderful! Terrific! The welcome was warm and inviting and we were given a table by the window and all seemed well
525,How we laughed and joked and smiled
526,But then it all came crashing down faster than Lehman Brothers in 2008
527,And it came down to the crucial element of any hospitality establishment - service and quality of the product
528,And I am afraid both were as terrible as each other
529,We were seated at just after 6pm
530,Drinks menu presented to us just over five minutes later
531,A bit slow but no problem as admiring the view and taking it all in
532,Still happy
533,Still smiling
534,Our order was taken 15 minutes later
535,Now that is slow
536,Not even in a pre cursory check after five minutes to see if we were ready
537,But still smiling
538,"Great company, great view and it's a Friday - what's the rush?! So now it is around 6.20pm"
539,Our drinks arrived just after 7
540,Not so happy
541,We were asked by three different people if we had ordered in that time and the original waitress came over at around 6.45 to say our drinks were on our way
542,That was just a lie really
543,If you are going to lie to me at least do it in a way that makes it believable at least
544,And preferably not when I am starting to dehydrate
545,(Yes not even a water was offered at this time - I am 38 floors up - I can't go find water for myself
546,I am not Bear Grylls!) But at least we have a drink! Sound the trumpets! Now let's hope they are worth the wait
547,They were not
548,Sigh
549,As for the cocktails themselves they were below average and not worth the money
550,It appears the alcohol may have been mixed with a Thames Water special but who am I to say? However they may have been tainted by the terrible service we had received
551,But fortunately we were compensated - by a small bowl of crisps
552,No offer of anything else and quite insulting really that it was deemed a bowl of crisps which cost no more then 10-15p at wholesale price was more than adequate as compensation for the 45 minute wait for two drinks
553,At least we wouldn't die of hunger
554,Amazingly we didn't fancy losing another hour of our lives waiting for another 'just serve it up and give it to them drink' so decided to leave
555,"Then, as for the cherry on this proverbial soggy bottomed cake (Mary would not be happy!), we had to go to the bar ourselves to pay the bill and, as our card was behind there to open the tab, it was automatically charged without us having a view of the bill let alone the chance to dispute anything on their including the 12.5% service charge! Thank the lord for that bowl of crisps! So in conclusion if you want to lose water weight before a bodybuilding competition come here"
556,Otherwise you are better off in other sky bars across London
557,And don't give them your card!
558,"We sat in the bar area for a light business lunch, after waiting 20 minutes the waitress took our drinks order, she was clearly new and nervous, this wasn't the problem but the 30 minutes then waiting again to order food was frustrating, then 20 minutes for the food to come, I received to orders of my meat board, I had to ask the restaurant receptionist for the bread, my colleague had ordered soup of the basis that cream was not in it, due to a dairy intolerance, unfortunately this was not the case"
559,"A 25 minute wait for the coffees was the final straw, as a local business we were hoping for a fabulous restaurant nearby for lunches, not many companies allow for a 2 hour lunch break, the views are the only thing that impressed.."
560,really disappointed 
561,"I am coming very often at Bokan with my friends and always had a great experience, nice cocktails and friendly staff"
562,However yesterday evening we did face a different attitude from the bartender Martina which was very rude to us and did not prepare the cocktail that we have asked and when we asked her for the cocktail that we wanted she started to argue saying that this is the cocktail and even start to laugh with her colleague and talking about us
563,I was shocked that at Bokan they still have people with this kind of attitude that don’t even bother about the guest requests
564,Very unprofessional
565,Really hope the management will take further actions.
566,Went for a drink at the bar but was ignored by staff
567,So I cannot comment on drinks or food
568,Restaurant might be nice but avoid the bar.
569,First waiting for a table at the entrance to see the staff letting others without reservation overtake us
570,Then at the table to waiter was so arrogant and rude that we simply left
571,Fantastic view though.
572,We visited the bar in December 2019
573,Waiting for a long time to be seated
574,Very nice views of London
575,Staff tends to ignore you
576,Cocktails served in different types of glasses
577,We did not enjoy the food in the restaurant.
578,This wasn’t my first time at Bokan’s but this time was disappointing
579,"Apart from the warm greeting by Constantine at our arrival and the spectacular views of London, the service, especially from one waitress was poor"
580,"It took a long time to order, she did not smile once and after ordering four drinks and four dishes, she presented the bill which already included 12.50% service charge demanding we pay it in full before taking one sip and well before receiving our food! If this is the bar’s policy (very peculiar to pay for food and service before even receiving it!), you should inform customers and explain it in a professional and friendly manner"
581,The food wasn’t even that great
582,Only worth the views
583,
584,"My wife and I celebrated our 1-year anniversary and booked Bokan, mostly for its lofty and impressive position on the 38th floor of the Novotel hotel in Canary Wharf, London"
585,"The view did not disappoint and we could see pretty much the whole of London from up there.Our table was booked for 8pm but they kept us waiting until 9pm, feeding us a constant stream of BS excuses (""The occupants of the table have just ordered another drink"", ""the occupants of the table have now asked for the bill, so it won't be much longer"", etc.)"
586,The waiting staff were patronising and inflexible and suggested that we ordered drinks at our expense until the table came free
587,At no time was any apology or solution offered
588,Bokan? Bo-can't.
589,"I ve been for the first time there, nice view but if you want some food at the bar, the best is to order the food first and the the drinks later, cuz it may take a while (in my case took more than 20 mins for some fries), the music is soo loud, it s like u re in a club, you can’t even have a discussion with the friends."
