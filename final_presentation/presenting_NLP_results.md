# Team 2: Presenting NLP results for Novotel Canary Wharf restaurant:

## Ultimate goal of NLP effort:

Implement an aspect based opinion miner for Novotel Canary Wharf restaurant and it's competitors (i.e. nearby restaurants), which automatically finds important features or aspects (e.g., food, service of waiters etc.) and generate an estimate of people's opinion on each of these aspects (i.e. opinion on food, opinion on service etc.). This way we can create a sentiment profile of Novotel Canary Wharf restaurant and each of its competitors, which can be used to compare and find out the restaurant features that should be further enhanced (i.e. features for which the sentiment profile for Novotel Canary Wharf restaurant is weaker compared to its competitors)

## What we achieved so far:

- Step 1: Scrapping reviews of Novotel Canary Wharf and its competitors on Tripadvisor
- Step 2: Data cleaning, tokenization, feature engineering, stemming & lemmatization, and text representation


## What we are planning to do next:

- Step 3: Word embedding  
- Step 4: Topic extraction
- Step 5: Sentiment Analysis

## Potential data visualizations for Monday's presentation:

- For step 1: there isn't many visualizations we can show, the most important metric here is the number of reviews we were able to collect for Novotel Canary Wharf restaurant and each of it's competitors
- For step 2:
    * Data cleaning and tokenization: word cloud for Novotel Canary Wharf restaurant and its competitors
    * Percentage of each rating per length review interval
    * Text representation: Find a way to visualize tf-idf
    * Much more visualizations will be possible after topic extraction when we have categories...
    * TO DO: think of more
