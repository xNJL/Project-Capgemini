After hours of research, I decided to make my reservation at The Peninsula online. I asked, with no expectations, if they would possibly spare a table by the window so that I could have the stunning view for my last night there. Again, no expectations on my part and I didn\'t expect them to waste a great table on one person! Upon arrival, I was greeted and taken to my incredible table - in the corner, right at the window where I was told ""as requested."" That alone meant so very much to me. Olga immediately came over to greet me and take my drink order and make me feel 100% comfortable - being alone was totally new to me but she made me completely relaxed and offered help or information whenever needed about the menu. I decided to go for the 7 course (why not!) and let me tell you, TREAT YOURSELF!!!! The chef is far too talented and the food is too exquisite to pass up every offering. No matter how full you are, keep eating. It\'s worth every bite. And the bread...it\'s what dreams are made of! The manager Domenico was so kind to me and made me feel like I was the only person in the whole restaurant - I was treated like an absolute queen. Chef Tomas even came out to bring a main course! From top to bottom, beginning to end, the meal was absolutely sublime. Each course was a textural symphony and the foie gras with a salted pancake? LIFE CHANGING. The creativity and thoughtfulness seen in each dish was phenomenal and every course kept getting more and more fabulous. The dessert was something I have been thinking about since I left! The banana tiramisu is just fantastic. Plus, the view was to die for. I\'ve never had a dinner where so many different textures were evident and everything was so perfectly balanced between salty, sweet, sour, crunchy, and creamy. I could not have imagined a better way to spend my last night in London - a stunning view, a gorgeous dinner, and the best treatment I\'ve ever received in a restaurant (I even got a surprise of a signed menu form Chef Tomas, how cool is that?!). There is no restaurant more deserving of a Michelin star. My heartfelt, never ending thanks to Domenico, Olga, Chef Tomas & the kitchen staff for giving me a beautiful experience and memory to last a lifetime. I am truly grateful and hope to someday head back to the Peninsula again.']", November 2018,g186338-d10148721-r633831364,g186338-d10148721,"['Value', 'Service', 'Food']","['50', '50', '50']",5,16 November 2018,Peninsula_Restaurant,/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d10148721-Reviews-Peninsula_Restaurant-London_England.html,"[['pencil-paper', '7'], ['thumbs-up-fill', '3']]","['Towaco, New Jersey']",DaniMarissa,Beautiful solo meal & send-off,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d10148721-r633831364-Peninsula_Restaurant-London_England.html

We used a voucher from Virgin but genuinely felt that the pricing was reasonable without it. Booking was difficult- for whatever reason there are a lot of phone agents that are hard to understand handling that side of things. At first we couldn't get through at all.

I suppose that I just feel style is no substitute for substance, which was lacking. We grew tired of each dish being drowned in au jus or sauce until every bite was a wet mess instead of leaving more textures in play. Tender I can appreciate, but the softness of every dish, being whipped or pureed made me feel like the menu is catered to a much, much older patron. Enjoying the foie gras, I had hardly enough time to appreciate the attention to detail before our waitress returned- she had forgotten yet another jus and on it went. Our ""cheese course"" was a single mozzarella stick served with honey olive oil and another dip. Having read great things about the cheeses on offer in the restaurant, I could only laugh. Hoping to end on a high we awaited our dessert which was unfortunately just another pretty but ultimately soft and bland banana pudding.

As with the hotel, the restaurant is really nicely decorated and immaculately clean. The staff were also very welcoming, making us feel like regular guests from the moment we arrived. I was a little disappointed with the menu but that is a matter of taste and preferences, so we decided to go with the tasting menu to try a little of various dishes. Although it wasn't listed on any of the menus we also asked about a matching wine flight which they said they did offer. We ordered a couple of cocktails which although we were warned that they were coming from the bar downstairs, did take ages to arrive. We were then presented with some amuse-bouche to wet our appetite and they were quite nice - 3 different types, 2 of which were really tasty but the 3rd (a Kimchi samosa) was unbelievably bland - could have been anything inside but definitely wasn't Kimchi. We had finished these by the time our cocktails had arrived, and then another waiter brought us another set of amuse-bouche. The 1st course then arrived but was a good few minutes before anyone brought us our glasses of matching wines. The service seemed a bit disfunctional & sporadic, which wasn't due to lack of staff as there were plenty of people milling around, just didn't seem that teams were communicating with each other correctly. The food of each course was slightly disappointing, some more so than others - presentation was beautiful but lacked basic seasoning & flavours. Had the beauty of a delicious dish but the taste didn't back this up. Since we had chosen the matching wines, we also expected some description from a sommelier or equivalent but at one point the waiter seemed to just be reading the back of the bottle - we could have described the wine better than he did. Unfortunately the night didn't back up the high reviews & left us wondering what the hype is all about. Certainly won't be rushing back & wouldn't recommend it to fine food lovers - for the price, there is far better in London.""]", January 2018,g186338-d10148721-r562002411,g186338-d10148721,"['Value', 'Service', 'Food']","['30', '40', '30']",3,21 February 2018,Peninsula_Restaurant,/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d10148721-Reviews-Peninsula_Restaurant-London_England.html,"[['pencil-paper', '167'], ['thumbs-up-fill', '124']]","['Hertfordshire, United Kingdom']",sus86london,Disappointingly average,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d10148721-r562002411-Peninsula_Restaurant-London_England.html

Nonetheless, we chose this restaurant after seeing chef Tomas’s work online and after reading numerous great reviews. I can confirm that we had one of our best dining our experiences in a very long time. My partner and I are into food and work within our industry ourselves so it is not as easy to impress us. However, chef Tomas and the sommelier Ucha, managed to do this without any doubt. It is visible throughout his food and ideas that Tomas is an experienced chef with new, unexpected ideas. He is also the one that can execute them very well. The sommelier, Ucha, seemed to have so much knowledge but was very interested to hear our thoughts. He could have acted like another know-it-all but he did not. Due to this we were able to develop an interesting conversation about food and wine. Other floor staff was very welcoming and greeted us warmly too. Definitely recommend visiting.
