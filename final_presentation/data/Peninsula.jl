One of the male waiters did not seem to know enough English to even understand some of the simple questions we asked.

And first appetizer was delicious ( Pumpkin Thai) with vey nice set up. The Octopus was also delicious with great presentation. Cons: but disappointments starts from 3rd appetizers and entries. BBQ prawn was almost raw and taste awful. The duck liver !!!! Taste so bad that I almost drink whole bottle of water to get rid of taste in my mouth. The Wagyu beef was also served raw with very disappointing presentation and taste so bad. These are their main entries not only taste bad, but also presented poorly. The dessert is also very very regular chocolate desert with nothing special, you can find similar taste in small cafe shop. This is my personal experience."]}

After hours of research, I decided to make my reservation at The Peninsula online. I asked, with no expectations, if they would possibly spare a table by the window so that I could have the stunning view for my last night there. Again, no expectations on my part and I didn't expect them to waste a great table on one person! Upon arrival, I was greeted and taken to my incredible table - in the corner, right at the window where I was told \"as requested.\" That alone meant so very much to me. Olga immediately came over to greet me and take my drink order and make me feel 100% comfortable - being alone was totally new to me but she made me completely relaxed and offered help or information whenever needed about the menu. I decided to go for the 7 course (why not!) and let me tell you, TREAT YOURSELF!!!! The chef is far too talented and the food is too exquisite to pass up every offering. No matter how full you are, keep eating. It's worth every bite. And the bread...it's what dreams are made of! The manager Domenico was so kind to me and made me feel like I was the only person in the whole restaurant - I was treated like an absolute queen. Chef Tomas even came out to bring a main course! From top to bottom, beginning to end, the meal was absolutely sublime. Each course was a textural symphony and the foie gras with a salted pancake? LIFE CHANGING. The creativity and thoughtfulness seen in each dish was phenomenal and every course kept getting more and more fabulous. The dessert was something I have been thinking about since I left! The banana tiramisu is just fantastic. Plus, the view was to die for. I've never had a dinner where so many different textures were evident and everything was so perfectly balanced between salty, sweet, sour, crunchy, and creamy. I could not have imagined a better way to spend my last night in London - a stunning view, a gorgeous dinner, and the best treatment I've ever received in a restaurant (I even got a surprise of a signed menu form Chef Tomas, how cool is that?!). There is no restaurant more deserving of a Michelin star. My heartfelt, never ending thanks to Domenico, Olga, Chef Tomas & the kitchen staff for giving me a beautiful experience and memory to last a lifetime. I am truly grateful and hope to someday head back to the Peninsula again."]}

The location is fantastic, the views are lovely and the atmosphere inside the restaurant is delightful, possibly because it was mostly empty for the duration of our meal. We used a voucher from Virgin but genuinely felt that the pricing was reasonable without it. Booking was difficult- for whatever reason there are a lot of phone agents that are hard to understand handling that side of things. At first we couldn't get through at all. We were eventually told to call later in the week because there was a convention at the hotel. It wasn't the best customer service that we've encountered, certainly.", "I was able to make a substitution which I did appreciate, and I also loved how painstakingly each dish in our seven course menu was plated. I suppose that I just feel style is no substitute for substance, which was lacking. We grew tired of each dish being drowned in au jus or sauce until every bite was a wet mess instead of leaving more textures in play. Tender I can appreciate, but the softness of every dish, being whipped or pureed made me feel like the menu is catered to a much, much older patron. Enjoying the foie gras, I had hardly enough time to appreciate the attention to detail before our waitress returned- she had forgotten yet another jus and on it went. Our \"cheese course\" was a single mozzarella stick served with honey olive oil and another dip. Having read great things about the cheeses on offer in the restaurant, I could only laugh. Hoping to end on a high we awaited our dessert which was unfortunately just another pretty but ultimately soft and bland banana pudding. I waited all evening for something that I could really get my teeth into but it never arrived. It's possible we just chose a less thrilling taster menu night, but for an occasion it was very disappointing."]}

We felt a little guilty not having wine with our meal but we are not big wine drinkers and much prefer plain old water when we experience food of this quality. The waiting staff were excellent and , if anything, a little too attentive but they had an excellent knowledge of the food they were serving and were clearly very proud to be presenting it. The restaurant has a lovely outlook over the river and has a very pleasant ambience. We had an added bonus of a pre starter and some petit four at the end of our meal which, with a liqueur coffee, finished off the evening perfectly.

As with the hotel, the restaurant is really nicely decorated and immaculately clean. The staff were also very welcoming, making us feel like regular guests from the moment we arrived. I was a little disappointed with the menu but that is a matter of taste and preferences, so we decided to go with the tasting menu to try a little of various dishes. Although it wasn't listed on any of the menus we also asked about a matching wine flight which they said they did offer. We ordered a couple of cocktails which although we were warned that they were coming from the bar downstairs, did take ages to arrive. We were then presented with some amuse-bouche to wet our appetite and they were quite nice - 3 different types, 2 of which were really tasty but the 3rd (a Kimchi samosa) was unbelievably bland - could have been anything inside but definitely wasn't Kimchi. We had finished these by the time our cocktails had arrived, and then another waiter brought us another set of amuse-bouche. The 1st course then arrived but was a good few minutes before anyone brought us our glasses of matching wines. The service seemed a bit disfunctional & sporadic, which wasn't due to lack of staff as there were plenty of people milling around, just didn't seem that teams were communicating with each other correctly. The food of each course was slightly disappointing, some more so than others - presentation was beautiful but lacked basic seasoning & flavours. Had the beauty of a delicious dish but the taste didn't back this up. Since we had chosen the matching wines, we also expected some description from a sommelier or equivalent but at one point the waiter seemed to just be reading the back of the bottle - we could have described the wine better than he did. Unfortunately the night didn't back up the high reviews & left us wondering what the hype is all about. Certainly won't be rushing back & wouldn't recommend it to fine food lovers - for the price, there is far better in London."]}

We chose this restaurant, funnily enough, for its location as the main purpose of our evening was to get as far away from central London as possible. Nonetheless, we chose this restaurant after seeing chef Tomas\u2019s work online and after reading numerous great reviews. I can confirm that we had one of our best dining our experiences in a very long time. My partner and I are into food and work within our industry ourselves so it is not as easy to impress us. However, chef Tomas and the sommelier Ucha, managed to do this without any doubt. It is visible throughout his food and ideas that Tomas is an experienced chef with new, unexpected ideas. He is also the one that can execute them very well. The sommelier, Ucha, seemed to have so much knowledge but was very interested to hear our thoughts. He could have acted like another know-it-all but he did not. Due to this we were able to develop an interesting conversation about food and wine. Other floor staff was very welcoming and greeted us warmly too. Definitely recommend visiting. We will be returning."]}

Our standards are high as we most recently experienced excellent cuisine at the restaurants of two other IC hotels in Canada.

The associate manager was quick to point out this new technology and informed us of its wonders. ", "Service: a best mix of European and British. Seen but not heard mixed with convivial repartee when the service called for it. While we were not the only table in the uncrowded restaurant we felt as if we were at a Chef's table. Well Done.

We loved it and the portions were generous without being over indulgent and the art of the dishes that included a savory ice cream were on par with anything in Paris.

My was starter consisted of rolled beef brisket serve with a lovely jus and caviar and it was amazing, tasty and perfectly cooked. For mains had duck confit leg served with rhubarb and mini broccoli stems and potato. Once again stunning and packed full of flavour and perfectly cooked maybe slightly over cooked should have been a little more pink. Anyway lovely and moist and dessert was chocolate ice cream and torte and was lovely. We both had a very memorable and special meal and they even brought out a small birthday cake on a black slate with Happy Birthday written on it with white icing. Thank you guys for making this evening a memorable one and hope to be back again soon. "]}

The service was outstanding and staff smiled throughout. To finish, the chef sent us some small sweets nestled on a bed of sesame seeds. That was a lovely touch and we left feeling, 'this deserves another visit'. Try the Sky bar on the top floor. Terrific view with waiter/waitress service. We only wished our waitress served us with a smile! Overall, a classy place to dine out. And would definitely recommend it."]}

The table was big and impeccable with white linen and stylish cutlery and glasses. The waiters were very friendly and made real contact which is always nice. The food was excellent. We chose the seven course tasting menu. The oister in champagne amuse was top, followed by salmon in beetroot. Very special combination with the sweet beetroot and the fish. This was followed by quail and hake and then also excellent beef. We concluded that we, as pretty spoiled europeans, have hardly ever eaten better and so refined in the UK, even though you cannot compare London with the UK. The wine was of fine quality too and not too expensive. The only negative thing we can think of is that it wasn't really a seven course menu, but actually five. But maybe thats a cultural thing. In our country you don't count an amuse and a spoom as a course but as a courtesy to your guests. But anyhow they tasted great. We can advise this place to everyone who wants a great meal in the higher ranks. And yes the view is impressing!"]}
