I even chose Bokan for Christmas lunch. I think I could be considered a good, if not a very loyal client. I have never pulled rank, never asked for special treatment and never got stressed out over the placement of the table. I have now planned a dinner for 6 at Bokan next month. For this one time I asked if I could reserve a table of my choice for this very special group of people to experience the restaurant. I was told very plainly and clearly ..... NO, IT IS NOT OUR POLICY! I was even told by one staff member that if I came 2 hours in advance of the dinner at 6pm I could then take the table of my choice because the place would be empty !!!! Now, I have been dining in the best restaurants in the world for about 60 years in fact long before any of the Bokan staff could even spell the word restaurant. The fact that for one time I'm not able to book a table of my choice proves several facts. 1. There is no restaurant / customer loyalty. 2. The management of the restaurant really has no idea what world class dining is about! 3. The customers of Bokan are merely a number and the place clearly caters to the transient diner with whom they need not establish a rapport or a relationship with. Considering this attitude of Bokan I will take my custom as well as my friends elsewhere. We will dine on the special evening mentioned at C. London (Cipriani) where I can book the table I feel comfortable at, where the table linens are as exquisite as the food and the white uniformed staff is smiling, courteous, and care about me ...... the customer.

On arrival, as a party of 4, we were not offered a drink but given the wine menu. So we selected a bottle of champagne. The waitress took our order for the champagne and the starters and main courses. She sent over the sommelier who recommended and left on the table a claret for the main course. We then waited for a while until the starters arrived whereby we had to chase up the champagne. When it finally arrived the waiter tried to take away the claret glasses until we retrieved them as we also had our claret, long before the champagne. Fortunately we had chosen cold starters. Then during the main course one of the waitresses leant right across the table to pour the jus rather than going around. The service continued rather haphazardly all evening.

We were shown to a table and were sat for probably about 15 minutes before our order (drink and food) was taken. Around 40 minutes later, we still hadn’t received our drinks, never mind the food. This was despite a couple who came in after us getting both food and drinks long before us. The waiters kept walking past and looking at the table and could clearly see we didn’t have any drinks yet, but did nothing about it. It wasn’t until I got the attention of a female member of staff, who looked to be in charge possibly and mentioned it to her that something started to be done. It was however, an hour, before we even got our drinks and then eventually our food came out. We were charged a £7.25 service charge, which seemed excessive seeing as it took so long to get anything to eat or drink. When the food arrived, it was ok but nothing special and certainly not worth the wait. I wouldn’t recommend this place, we certainly weren’t made to feel very welcome and nothing was offered as an apology for the poor service.

Unfortunately for us the whole terrace had been booked for the evening so we had drinks on floor 38 instead. I had only found this out this morning when the receptionist called to confirm our reservation. This was mentioned on the website but I hadn’t thoroughly checked it. The guy on reception on 38 was very welcoming and perfect for front of house. The bar staff were very friendly and the guy that served our drinks at the table on 38 enjoyed conversation and a joke or two. As we were leaving to go to the restaurant I had half-jokingly asked him whether the tip we gave him included a quick sneak view of the party upstairs he became quite serious and said it was not possible. Maybe I read it wrongly but he seemed a little distant from that moment. At 7pm the restaurant had only 2-3 other tables booked and we were served quickly. Our waiter, Cristian, was a delight. Both the receptionist that called this morning and Cristian checked to see whether there were any allergies and also asked whether it was a special occasion. After choosing our mains and changing one meal there was a slight mix-up. This minor error with our meal choices would have been quickly corrected but we were happy to proceed as presented and the beef and duck choices were delicious as were the desserts. It was a slightly higher price than expected with a main, a side and a dessert each, with just one glass of wine at the table around £60 per head. To me the docklands area has a slightly distant ‘unreal’ feel to it and there was less interaction with other customers in this establishment than we usually find in The City and West End. This could well change depending on the night and could also be my own personal take on the vibe. I personally love the established feel about more historic areas in London.']", July 2019,g186338-d12156905-r688789999,g186338-d12156905,"['Value', 'Service', 'Food']","['40', '50', '50']",4,11 July 2019,Bokan_37_Restaurant,/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d12156905-Reviews-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html,"[['pencil-paper', '100'], ['thumbs-up-fill', '22']]",[],Keith W,Couldn't get to the roof terrace...,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r688789999-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html

Likewise, the waiters were unable to explain certain items on the dinner menu, i.e. what they were or how they were prepared. Everything took an absolutely extraordinary amount of time to arrive.

They were effortlessly friendly and professional. Nothing was too much trouble. Honestly top notch staff! The food was delightful - we had the three course set menu, including the royal wedding cake. We even got a little bag of token chocolates to take with us, which was a lovely touch.

We always walk-in and very kind reception ladies try to accommodate and find a table for you. 6 of us went to the restaurant a couple of weeks ago and had an amazing time - bill was £500 but we had great food, amazing wine. However, let me tell one very important thing - bar team and waitress are always rude (not restaurant\'s). I never complained to any of the managers but I cannot hide it anymore. The last time I went there - we were 3 ladies and ordered a bottle of wine. The waitress brought 2 glasses only but and I kindly asked to get 1 more glass (obviously). We waited for 15 minutes but there was no one and still didnt get the glass. I went to the bar, no one paid any attention. Then I found the same waitress and again KINDLY asked to get an empty glass because we are 3. She was so arrogant and started to show her embarrassment by saying: ""I told you that I\'m bringing it."" I cannot believe.. I said I cant wait any longer because it has been more than 15 minutes! Then she was putting an order to the till and just ignored me completely. I turned to the bar and waited for anyone to look at me and requested a glass by raising my voice: PLEASE Is anyone can pass me an empty glass? It was such an awkward situation.... After 25 minutes we finally had a possibility to enjoy our wine. Next time I tried to get a recommendation about Riesling wine which they used to have on the old drinks menu. The bartender didn\'t show any interest in even trying to find my taste. And there is always issues with the bar team and this particular floor - I don\'t understand why? General manager and restaurant manager need to look into this as I can see from the other reviews - it\'s happening very often. I think they are all demotivated or tired. To be honest with you, I will try to look for another good place in Canary Wharf on the top floor (didnt try any of other yet) because of this bar and team\'s attitude as I can\'t bother anymore - it always changes my mood.']", May 2018,g186338-d12156905-r585263636,g186338-d12156905,"['Value', 'Service', 'Food']","['30', '10', '40']",3,5 June 2018,Bokan_37_Restaurant,/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d12156905-Reviews-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html,"[['pencil-paper', '8'], ['thumbs-up-fill', '7']]",[],Er V,I've been so many times,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r585263636-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html

My first course was \'Octpus and Beetroot"" and it was hard to get the taste of either of these components. Seemed like it had been boiled for hours. Second course was lamb which was equally \'non-lamby\' in taste. The wine list was all highly priced, and from unknown vineyards. We had a Spanish wine from an area with which we are familiar. The wine was good, in that it had no bad qualities, but not much going for it either. BUT THE VIEW FROM THE RESTAURANT IS FANTASTIC. A meal for two with wine set us back £175.

We were always going out after but really wanted to visit this place as it has of course recently opened and looked amazing. ', 'When we arrived we were a little early so fully understandable that the table wasn’t ready but saying that, I called a good 30 mins before we was going to arrive and whoever answered the phone said the table was already ready. We stood there awkwardly in everyone’s way by the entrance for a good 10 minutes waiting for someone to simply wipe down the table and clear the glasses so we could take a seat. As we finally got taken over to the table 3 of the 5 of us take a seat and 2 of us left standing as there was only 3 chairs when the booking was for 5! ', 'As your waiter frantically panicked looking for 2 chairs, lucky another table offered us their 2 stools as your waiter came back saying he couldn’t find any. By now you can imagine I wanted to just get up and leave due to the shambles going on around me. Couldn’t get a table with enough chairs, could just about get my table and everyone seemed a little too busy to listen to what I was saying or to help. Seemed a little under staffed to me.', 'Finally we are at the table and 15 minutes later we get given the menu so we can order a drink. After waiting another 20 mins for her to come back and take our order, we sat there patiently and waited for our drinks. By now I wondered if they were ever going to turn up but eventually they did. I didn’t think it took that long to make a drink, we didn’t even order food! Again, must have been understaffed as it wasn’t particularly busy but all we have done so far is wait. Extremely inattentive.', 'The drinks finally arrive! I have ordered my favourite cocktail (that isn’t even on the menu) a Pornstar Martini. At first glance is looked amazing and by now I was so thirsty I was ready to drink it in 1! I sat there and thought, this is going to be so good and make up for the experience we have had so far, but…. It was rancid. I don’t know if your bar staff have ever had a pornstar martini anywhere else but I have never had such a sour tasting, dry, small pornstar martini in my life. Even the prosecco on the side was again, extremely dry and sour to the taste. I would never order a Pornstar Martini from here ever again, even worse that one I have had from the likes of Be At One or All Bar One and this is supposed to be an amazing rooftop bar competing with the likes of Radio Rooftop and Rumpus Rooms and it was just not even comparable. Id compare it from my experience so far to my local Weather Spoons.', 'Right, ive had enough, we are leaving, attic bar is around the corner and ive been there before and know it is a safe bet. This is me trying to salvage what dignity I have left as I have recommended this to everyone and booked it for a friends Birthday and it was just a shambles. Trying my best to keep spirits high as everyone looks like they have just had enough and want to go home.', 'I manage to finally get hold of someone to get my bill as no one is giving eye contact so unless you chase after them, you are out of luck. I hand over this little business card that you get free at the front with a little number on it to get my card back (cant even supply the plastic tabs) and 10 minutes later get my card, and guess what? The completely wrong receipt.', 'You literally managed to give me my card back with someone’s else’s receipt order. You can imagine how this looks, you could have given my card to the right person or if I hadn’t have checked it, I would have paid nearly a £300 bill for my 5 drink order.', 'I flag this up immediately to get my correct receipt. With this one I ask politely to take the service charge off my receipt as I refuse to pay 12.5% for what was terrible service. Your waiter comes back with yet another receipt. This time it is our order but there appears to be an extra bottle of Rose wine on there! Again not what I ordered. Like how bloody hard isit to print a receipt out of what we ordered on our tab with our table number? Obviously very difficult.', 'This isn’t the end though, here comes the embarrassing bit your end. When she (the original guy was obviously too embarrassed to come over) comes over to take the payment she asks ‘Why do you not want to pay the service’, I hate to say it as I am not a rude person, but I laughed in her face, I said you cant prepare a table with 5 chairs, cant put correct orders onto a receipt and im surprised I even got my bank card back. And you want me to pay you for this? She stood there stunned and said ‘the company make us ask’. ', 'If this is true then you should be ashamed of yourselves. You charge good money for drinks alone but then expecting me to pay the extra 12.5% for the worst service I have ever received. I have received better service ordering a Bic Mac at 4am. It is up to the people paying if they want to pay service charge, hence why it is optional. To make your staff ask as to why is horrendous, everyone was looking at them and to think that is going to put me on the spot like it would most people, you are very wrong. I raised my voice and explained exactly why as your other customers listened in, in shock.', 'I don’t know if this was just a bad experience I had or if this is just what to expect from this place. Big name, great advertising, well set up with amazing views and good money spent on the interior! But as to the service, staff and drinks, unless I see a lot of good reviews go in soon, I don’t think I will be going back or recommending this to any one I know.

For starter we shared the Bokan board which had a selection of charcuterie, cheese, pate and a scotch egg. The pate lacked a bit of flavour but the scotch egg was perfectly cooked with a runny centre. For main we had the pork belly and venison pie, both were very tasty.

It's on the 37th floor, accessed by an impressively swift lift to the 38th floor bar and reception area, itself just below the 39th floor roof terrace. Unsurprisingly it's biggest attraction is the view it commands over vast swathes of London and from my seat northwards as far as Hertfordshire. A pity then our view was impeded by the fact we were seated at what seemed to be the only table adjacent not to a window but a metal frame. In addition to the a la carte was a lunch menu featuring two courses for £22 and three for £26. This represented quite a bargain compared with the a la carte many of whose mains (without sides) cost as much if not more than three courses on the set menu. The 50% discount on food as part of the soft launch, however, gave us an excuse to go a la carte. There is no children's menu (indeed my daughter appeared to be the only child dining) but a main of spaghetti with tomatoes and pesto was served with our staters and, as requested, without olives. It was such a substantial dish it kept her occupied beyond the finish of our mains. My wife started with burrata which was suitably creamy although the accompanying crackers were not particularly crispy. My steak tartare was beautifully served on a plate with little spots of dressing but could have had more egg yolk whisked in than I noticed. My main, a poached fillet of cod on a bed of spinach with shrimps covered in a brown foam was a sensational dish, but at £26 at full price perhaps needed to be. My wife's chunks of salmon on green beans looked a little more prosaic by comparison. A ginger pudding we shared for desert hit another high note, but the bitter stewed espressos were fairly horrible. My wife and I are admittedly fussy about coffee but never cease to be amazed by the sheer unpleasantness of espressos served in so many venues in London including those that specialise in coffee such as Caravan who really ought to know better. We enjoyed our glasses of house white until they were shown on the bill as Chablis at a fairly astonishing £9 per glass as opposed to the £5.40 for the eminently quaffable vin du maison. So all in all an accomplished meal not without the odd blip and, in common with the location of the restaurant within the hotel itself, not quite hitting the heights.""]", March 2017,g186338-d12156905-r464803410,g186338-d12156905,[],[],4,5 March 2017,Bokan_37_Restaurant,/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d12156905-Reviews-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html,"[['pencil-paper', '2803'], ['thumbs-up-fill', '1254']]","['London, United Kingdom']",futtock21,Not quite the tips,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r464803410-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html
