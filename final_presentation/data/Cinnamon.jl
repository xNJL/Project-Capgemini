The blonde waitress who understandably English is not her first language misunderstood the requests made which led to us being overcharged.

It was always a priority when I worked in bars and restaurants, but food was coming up for another table, so H & S went by the wayside. As I have said, it wasn't busy and I really don't think broken glass should be left and this is something that should be checked properly. As it was, he left it behind a sign for quite some time - it still wasn't cleared away when we left. I would never had allowed this when I ran a pub.", "Everyone was pleasant, but I just don't think they were organised enough. Would I go again? The food was good, but service is part of the whole thing for me, and there are so many other places to go in London, maybe not. That's a real shame for the chef."]}

The chips were cooked unevenly,some brown and some under cooked and not crispy on the outside at all. The calamari looked like scraps and was incredibly greasy.

I really liked the Victoria sponge cake and this other thing don't know what it's called but had fruits and jelly in a crust. W another negative thing is they only had time slots between 1-3 which is very odd because that's lunchtime! I have tea around 5. So it was very awkward we couldn't decide if we should have an early lunch. But then we would be too full. When we saw the snacks we were thinking we're gonna wipe it clean but in actual fact it was very filling and we couldn't finish it off had so much left over. Overall I think afternoon tea should be cosier more homey and definitely not at 1pm!!after this o went to another afternoon tea in Scunthorpe called giles absolutely loves it it was very vintage deco everything suited.

My friends and I had purchased group on vouchers in 2012 for the cinnamon restaurant at Hilton Canary Wharf and the vouchers expired in January 2013. This meant that over the festive season of 2012 we were enjoying brunches on a Sunday morning with family and friends and even got to celebrate my son's and dad's birthday together as a family gathering. The deal was \u00a319 for two adults but you could add children at \u00a36 each at the restaurant. ", "Where do I start? Well the ambiance was fantabulous to say the least, very comfortable furnishings which although classy enough was still very child friendly. The staff could not be more accommodating which is what one would expect from somewhere like the Hilton. They were all so attentive and child friendly. Our party was filled with lots of children and we never once felt the we needed to apologise for this.", "The food? Well certainly the star of the show. The variety of choices for breakfast was amazing but not just variety and quantity but also quality and well prepared. Then there was the choice of meal from the lunch menu which was like a fusion Asian theme and it did not disappoint!", "If it was not for the groupon deal I probably would not have been aware of it and without the deal it would have been far more pricey but based on the quality of food, services and ambience I would gladly pay full price to have brunch here once per month. Unfortunately this morning I rang up to book a table for two adults two kids fro brunch and was told that they no longer do brunches, only breakfast. They don't even do lunches anymore. I was so disappointed to say the least. I guess perhaps they were unable to sustain brunches as that side of Canary wharf is not very busy on weekends and they could not keep doing groupon deals. Shame as I've not been able to find anywhere else in South East to do a brunch as good.", "By the way I've put October 2013 only because they won't allow the date to go back as far as 2012 and I feel it would be an injustice if I didn't write this review even though they no longer do brunches. Thunk we might try their breakfast though and will let you know how that goes."]}

Unfortunately our waiter didn't have much understanding of English and had to be helped out constantly by his colleague, who was only marginally better.

The fish, coated with a layer of courgette slices, was actually cooked for the correct length of time, but was spiced into oblivion and didn't seem too fresh. The crab, leek and pea ragu underneath it was absolutely vile, again spiced into oblivion but I could still manage to taste that the crab seemed tinned. The third element was harissa, which was decent enough but I'd had enough spice by now. In case you're wondering, I do actually like spicy food - even extremely hot food when called for - but not when the spices obscure all the other flavours on the plate. Another thing I would have liked here was a bit of crunch, there was nothing in this dish with any real bite resistance.", "My companion had lamb knuckle. This was marginally better but rather boring, particularly the limp-tasting sauce. Too much gristle remained in the lamb, and a piece of string had somehow made its way onto the plate. ", "We shared a chocolate & chilli fondant for dessert, this was better than either of the main courses but again uninspiring, the chilli taste was too subtle (must have all been used up in the bream) and was just dry heat without a trace of the fruitiness I was hoping for. ", "None of this was particularly cheap - I believe our mains were in the \u00a318 price range, which is quite excessive when the quality is sub-Cafe Rouge. I have guesstimated a price of \u00a335-40 for 3 courses exc drinks and service. This makes it a place to avoid with extreme prejudice."]}
