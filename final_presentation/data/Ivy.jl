This went off to a bad start because, the waitress spotted that I had brought my own birthday cake with me and wanted to take that away to the reception. ", "Following, I asked to speak to a manager about this and had an unfortunate experience talking to Audrius, who I found lacked any kind of human emotion and was frankly facetious and patronising, there was obviously no negotiation on their matter of their \"health and safety policy\" over bringing external cakes, although it was clear from Audrius that the issue was really about the effect it would have on dessert sales. Audrius explained that this happens a lot, and many guest find themselves in my position and allowing any discretion would mean people: \"bringing their own wine or dogs to the restaurant\u201d. This indicates to me, that customers have a desire to do exactly as I had done, and that the restaurant itself is not listening to customers\u2019 desires or needs. Anyway, the discussion ended with him saying \"You have a choice to make?\", when I enquired as to the choice, I was told: \"To sit down and enjoy your meal or not?\", which I thought was unprofessional. If this was my brand I would not have such a person represent it.", "Notwithstanding that the Ivy is not a patisserie, does not specialise in birthday cakes and anything they would have offered would have been far inferior. What is more frustrating is that when I called the restaurant prior to the booking, I was told that they can only provide birthday cakes for up to 5 people, and since there were 8 of us, this was not an option. Although Audrius insisted this was not the case, so not only poor management, but poor staff advice led to this situation occurring.", "Even other restaurant guests who overheard the conversation made the effort to to approach us and offer their supporting voices that this was a ridiculous policy.", "Talking to one of the other managers, Alex, when we left, who I found much more personable, and at least had the trait of human empathy, which honestly is the minimum I would expect from anyone in the hospitality industry. It was nice that someone in the restaurant was able to consider my situation and that of my guests from our perspective.", "Food was less than the Ivy standard I have come to know which was extremely disappointing, especially as I introduced so many people to the Ivy for the first time and talked it up, perhaps it was just this particular restaurant, but I will never come here again, nor would I expect that from my guests who came for the first time. Several of us, commented was lacking in various ways. Unfortunately this occasion did not live up to my high expectations from the Ivy that I've enjoyed at many other locations across London as a regular customer, but the \"Ivy in the Park - Canary Wharf\" has left me burnt and offended.", "I seriously urge a reconsideration on the birthday cake policy, it\u2019s surely a classic managerial short sightedness where you intend to increase revenue by potentially increasing sales of desserts on a single occasion, but neglect that you offend customers and limit future sales when people who\u2019ve enjoyed friendly and accommodating service come back time and time again. Not to mention that even bringing your own cake means that customers would still purchase teas and coffees. Due to the hostility in this restaurant we took the cake and made the celebrations at another local venue who were more than happy to give us a table when we purchased a few drinks to go with it!"]}

As we wanted some cheese to go with our remaining wine we sat sipping water, once ordered the cheese took ages to arrive to the point that we asked ourselves who had ordered something complicated!

Then the accompaniments did not arrive until we had finished. I raised this with the manager who said he would give me a coffee and a free meal next time. I waited for the coffee for 15 minutes, it did not arrive and the manager was talking, for an inordinate amount of time to another customer. Literally the most jaw dropping service experience of my life! I followed this up with feedback on their website and have never had a response, this was almost a month ago now..........just woeful. Having eaten at the original Ivy, i cannot help but feel they have overstretched and will end up like many other chains."]}

First impressions of the premises was good, attractive restaurant, in great location to Canary Wharf shops and station. Warmly greeted, but the reception area full of buggies that could have been left elsewhere. Shown to a lovely table upstairs with view of the ice rink. Orders taken promptly by a friendly server. One of our party ordered eggs Benedict, another the pancakes, and the monkfish prawn curry for myself. When the food arrived, initial reaction was that the curry portion was small, minimal prawns and little chunks of monkfish. The monkfish however was tough and could have passed for poorly cooked lamb in texture. The server apologised and took the curry away, after I'd said that should the monkfish be the same in kitchen, to replace it with more prawn. My husband and daughter had of course finished their meals by then, my daughter having enjoyed the Eggs Benedict, and my husband finding the pancakes nondescript. After waiting 15 minutes my meal arrived, served by one of the managers apologising for the problem. To my dismay, noticed that the replacement dish contained only three prawns, the same amount that had been left in the dish originally, ( i would add the prawns were only small , all could have fitted on a dessert spoon, this is being generous) all floating in the curry sauce. Additionally, no thought had been made to replace the side dishes of vegetables which were now stone cold. The Manager asked if he could replace the food, but by then as everyone had finished, i politely refused. He did offer a dessert or a glass of champagne, but again this was declined. When the bill arrived, the curry had been deducted, plus one cup of coffee. I thought this was a miserly gesture, particularly as it had been a celebration meal, poor food and we had not eaten together. I would say that some chocolates and a mini pastry had been left on the table which was acknowledged with thanks. Overall this was not a good dining experience, not one that I would expect from the Ivy chain of cafes."]}

This was a \u2018proper\u2019 pie with a flaky shortcrust bottom and not just a pastry top.

From the menu we selected the truffled orzo pasta and the scallops for starters, which were both good, then tuna loin and shepherds pie for mains with sides of spinach and truffle chips. It turned out that the sides probably weren't needed but we succumbed to the upselling from the waitress. Both main dishes were very good, well cooked and flavoursome. For dessert we shared the passion fruit baked Alaska, which was a nice balance of sweet and tangy. To drink we shared an entry-price bottle of Bordeaux which we enjoyed. Water was topped up regularly. It was a nice atmosphere and service was good apart from the upselling. Overall a very nice meal."]}
