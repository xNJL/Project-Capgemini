I even chose Bokan for Christmas lunch. I think I could be considered a good, if not a very loyal client. I have never pulled rank, never asked for special treatment and never got stressed out over the placement of the table. I have now planned a dinner for 6 at Bokan next month. For this one time I asked if I could reserve a table of my choice for this very special group of people to experience the restaurant. I was told very plainly and clearly ..... NO, IT IS NOT OUR POLICY! I was even told by one staff member that if I came 2 hours in advance of the dinner at 6pm I could then take the table of my choice because the place would be empty !!!! Now, I have been dining in the best restaurants in the world for about 60 years in fact long before any of the Bokan staff could even spell the word restaurant. The fact that for one time I'm not able to book a table of my choice proves several facts. 1. There is no restaurant / customer loyalty. 2. The management of the restaurant really has no idea what world class dining is about! 3. The customers of Bokan are merely a number and the place clearly caters to the transient diner with whom they need not establish a rapport or a relationship with. Considering this attitude of Bokan I will take my custom as well as my friends elsewhere. We will dine on the special evening mentioned at C. London (Cipriani) where I can book the table I feel comfortable at, where the table linens are as exquisite as the food and the white uniformed staff is smiling, courteous, and care about me ...... the customer. Goodbye Bokan. Your mediocre service will not take you far. By the way, The Ivy In The Park is also a wonderful restaurant that cares about their clients."]}

So I expected the service to be top class too. However, it was very disjointed. On arrival, as a party of 4, we were not offered a drink but given the wine menu. So we selected a bottle of champagne. The waitress took our order for the champagne and the starters and main courses. She sent over the sommelier who recommended and left on the table a claret for the main course. We then waited for a while until the starters arrived whereby we had to chase up the champagne. When it finally arrived the waiter tried to take away the claret glasses until we retrieved them as we also had our claret, long before the champagne. Fortunately we had chosen cold starters. Then during the main course one of the waitresses leant right across the table to pour the jus rather than going around. The service continued rather haphazardly all evening. Overall, the view is lovely, the food is tasty and beautifully presented but the kitchen is let down by a disorganised (but friendly) waiting staff."]}

Unfortunately for us the whole terrace had been booked for the evening so we had drinks on floor 38 instead. I had only found this out this morning when the receptionist called to confirm our reservation. This was mentioned on the website but I hadn\u2019t thoroughly checked it. The guy on reception on 38 was very welcoming and perfect for front of house. The bar staff were very friendly and the guy that served our drinks at the table on 38 enjoyed conversation and a joke or two. As we were leaving to go to the restaurant I had half-jokingly asked him whether the tip we gave him included a quick sneak view of the party upstairs he became quite serious and said it was not possible. Maybe I read it wrongly but he seemed a little distant from that moment. At 7pm the restaurant had only 2-3 other tables booked and we were served quickly. Our waiter, Cristian, was a delight. Both the receptionist that called this morning and Cristian checked to see whether there were any allergies and also asked whether it was a special occasion. After choosing our mains and changing one meal there was a slight mix-up. This minor error with our meal choices would have been quickly corrected but we were happy to proceed as presented and the beef and duck choices were delicious as were the desserts. It was a slightly higher price than expected with a main, a side and a dessert each, with just one glass of wine at the table around \u00a360 per head. To me the docklands area has a slightly distant \u2018unreal\u2019 feel to it and there was less interaction with other customers in this establishment than we usually find in The City and West End. This could well change depending on the night and could also be my own personal take on the vibe. I personally love the established feel about more historic areas in London."]}

Likewise, the waiters were unable to explain certain items on the dinner menu, i.e. what they were or how they were prepared. Everything took an absolutely extraordinary amount of time to arrive.

We could be regulars, but I\u2019m worried to go back and have the same experience. This area is in dire need of some outstanding restaurants, and it would be good if Bokan cleaned up their act and invested in better service staff.

And I was so impressed. The staff are very knowledgeable. The card offers vegitarian, fish and meat... and the quality of the food was awesome. Beautiful starter, Great entree and the cheese for dessert is to die for. And then a big shout out to our waiter Guillaume. Adviced us a Great wine that both matched the bouillabaisse and the red meat. And he Made lots of little Jokes to make us feel special. And WHERE DID THEY FIND CHEF AURELIE?! Working it in her open kitchen was a joy to watch. Make a reservation! Enjoy the view of London and be heart warmed. "]}

We actually visited on 19th May, which is our wedding anniversary as well as being the date of the Royal wedding. The place was absolutely buzzing with wonderful happy vibes due to the special occasion that many were there to watch on the large screens. We watched a bit and I have to say it was nothing short of spectacular to be able to watch the royal wedding with the London skyline as the back drop. They really had set things out nicely for those wanting to come along and partake in this celebration. We were made to feel extra special as it was our anniversary and every member of staff we encountered gave us their best wishes. We were seated and the views were, in my opinion, the best I have ever experienced in London. We were served by Guillaume and also the husband and wife team. They were effortlessly friendly and professional. Nothing was too much trouble. Honestly top notch staff! The food was delightful - we had the three course set menu, including the royal wedding cake. We even got a little bag of token chocolates to take with us, which was a lovely touch. The drinks flowed and we had an absolutely fantastic anniversary; and it was down to the incredible location and views, the food, the fabulous atmosphere and the amazing staff. Thank you! We will be back again for sure."]}

It was time for me to explain the reason for this... ", "I dropped to one knee and told her exactly what she meant to me and the rest is history: SHE SAID YES! :D", "Moments later, after the screams of happiness and tears had ensued, the Manager had re-appeared with 2 glasses and an ice bucket of prosecco in the other. ", "He congratulated us and assured us that we could take our time and enjoy the terrace for a while longer, as we took in the moment. The gods were seriously in my favour that day, as the weather was magnificent and i really cannot serve justice to the views on offer, with my limited vocabulary.", "I'd like to thank everyone at The Bokan for helping me to orchestrate this special moment in our lives so perfectly and for going above and beyond. ", "I recommend this restaurant to anyone and all the better if you are looking to celebrate a special occasion. we will certainly be returning for the brunch in the future and i will be telling the story of how you helped me to nail my proposal plans. ", "Lastly, i want to apologise again that i was unable to catch the restaurant Manager's name as i of course had a lot on my mind that day, but he was just incredible throughout.

When the food arrived, it was... below average. Not even average. At least, that was the case for me (I had a fried salmon... it seemed like their twist on fish and chips but the flavours were not a good combo, shall we just say). Now if you asked my fiance, the response is more like \"the food was horrible\" because he got a terrible case of food poisoning that very evening, after the lunch we had there.

The chef favours undercooked fish, but will cook meat to your taste. The vegetarian options are tasty and include cheese, but I think a vegan may struggle to find something unless the restaurant is advised in advance. Definitely a place to go - if you don't eat, hang out in the bar."]}

We always walk-in and very kind reception ladies try to accommodate and find a table for you. 6 of us went to the restaurant a couple of weeks ago and had an amazing time - bill was \u00a3500 but we had great food, amazing wine. However, let me tell one very important thing - bar team and waitress are always rude (not restaurant's). I never complained to any of the managers but I cannot hide it anymore. The last time I went there - we were 3 ladies and ordered a bottle of wine. The waitress brought 2 glasses only but and I kindly asked to get 1 more glass (obviously). We waited for 15 minutes but there was no one and still didnt get the glass. I went to the bar, no one paid any attention. Then I found the same waitress and again KINDLY asked to get an empty glass because we are 3. She was so arrogant and started to show her embarrassment by saying: \"I told you that I'm bringing it.\" I cannot believe.. I said I cant wait any longer because it has been more than 15 minutes! Then she was putting an order to the till and just ignored me completely. I turned to the bar and waited for anyone to look at me and requested a glass by raising my voice: PLEASE Is anyone can pass me an empty glass? It was such an awkward situation.... After 25 minutes we finally had a possibility to enjoy our wine. Next time I tried to get a recommendation about Riesling wine which they used to have on the old drinks menu. The bartender didn't show any interest in even trying to find my taste. And there is always issues with the bar team and this particular floor - I don't understand why? General manager and restaurant manager need to look into this as I can see from the other reviews - it's happening very often. I think they are all demotivated or tired. To be honest with you, I will try to look for another good place in Canary Wharf on the top floor (didnt try any of other yet) because of this bar and team's attitude as I can't bother anymore - it always changes my mood."]}

This was not an appropriate time to be breaking down tables while the restaurant was still half full. There was no presence of management at all.", "Once my food was ready I could see it on the counter, with severel people touching it with their fingers to see if it's cooked properly.

Coffee \u2615, mid day lunches , mid day drinks, late night drinks , jazz evenings , friends reunions\ufe0f, dates or just chilled afternoons are so far just a few reasons for why I keep ending up on that 38th floor with all them stunning views. ", "The best part of it all- it's becoming almost like visiting a family. Except you obviously have to pay at Bokan... haha! Team is genuinely what makes my every single time so much more exciting and so much better. Veni and Teodora are usually two faces meeting you the moment you step out of elevator and God is it a gorgeous duo! And then there's this young gentleman, who's name I still can't remember for some reason, sorry ( he's having his haircut in Canary Wharf ), but he's your guy if you want not only a good service, but also to explore some of the best cocktails! ", "In summary, I could probably be Bokan's ambassador by now, but I know how important and nice it is to hear about good experiences, not only negative ones. Trust there are not many of those though. Thank you guys "]}

I was greeted and shown to a table and although initially service was attentive I was not given guidance on allergens in the menu and I had to try ordering a few options until I got one I could have. I would have expected the waiter to be more clued up on allergens and to be more helpful. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a cheap restaurant. When my steak came the meat was cooked medium rare as requested but it wasn\u2019t a good piece of meat and was quite chewy. I\u2019m from a farming family so I know good steak and that wasn\u2019t the quality I\u2019d expect at a restaurant of this calibre. Something had been excluded from the dish due to my gluten intolerance but that had not been pointed out when I ordered. So, great that it was omitted however this should have been mentioned at the time of ordering. The \u201cAmuse Bouche\u201d was just brought to me and I had to request the waiter check the ingredients before I had it - again disappointing. I actually felt like I was a pain to the servers because of my allergies and other tables seemed to get more attentive service as I was sat there with an empty glass for ages and being ignored.

As far as we could figure, the highest floor comprises a bar with bookable table seating, with a limited bar menu, and VERY loud music. No conversation possible. On the floor below, down a short staircase, is the main restaurant, where we were booked. The 'music' noise from above resounds, but the volume is thankfully lower. Although is was Friday, and a couple of weeks before Christmas, this lower area was sparsely populated. This was a surprise.", "The menu, in our opinion, is very limited and fairly boring. The service is not too bad, but rather mechanical: eg. you are asked if you are 'enjoying' at critical points. The food is nicely and artistically presented on the plates, but too our surprise is not vey tasty. 'BLAND\" is the word that came to mind. My first course was 'Octpus and Beetroot\" and it was hard to get the taste of either of these components. Seemed like it had been boiled for hours. Second course was lamb which was equally 'non-lamby' in taste. The wine list was all highly priced, and from unknown vineyards. We had a Spanish wine from an area with which we are familiar. The wine was good, in that it had no bad qualities, but not much going for it either. BUT THE VIEW FROM THE RESTAURANT IS FANTASTIC. A meal for two with wine set us back \u00a3175. I rationalise this as good value, being \u00a3125 for the view and \u00a350 for the rest."]}

Their booking policy for the terrace appears to be simply untruthful and misleading. It's understandable that during good weather it will be busy. What is unacceptable is when you ask them to book they say that the system is blocked. Even if you say that you will call later they say that you cannot book and that you will have to walk in early. You walk in early and surprise surprise, everything is already booked for the day! So basically they will not tell you that they are fully booked and you're lured in by the hope that there will be availability.

I even stood at the bar wanting a glass of wine, was standing right in front of the bartender who was YES I KNOW very busy, but he could have at least acknowledge my presence......It took for ever to get a glass of wine, and than had to ask for my check......Having said that the staff for the brunch if wonderful and if this obvious they are there to serve you and make sure your visit is as enjoyable as possible. Another comment, is that there doesn't seem to be enough tables on the 3 floors to accommodate the number of guests staying at the hotel. Also, there was NO information in the room for phone numbers such as room service, front desk, wakeup call, etc....and no visitor guide or magazine. I do have to say that these are minor issues and the hotel still deserves a 4.9 stars our of five........."]}

The starters were magnificent, such intense and amazing flavours. When the main course came none of us were disappointed. The steak, fish and chicken dishes were cooked to perfection and accompanied with eye catching pur\u00e9es and foams that were packed with complimentary flavours. The wine was great, also full of flavour but not overbearing - just right! It seemed a shame to stop at the main course...the puddings and cheeses matched the quality and flavours we had already experienced and the sommelier picked us a wonderful wine to finish. Our waiter did a fantastic job and saw to all our every need. Thank you Bokan for making our celebration so enjoyable. "]}

We were certainly not disappointed, they are really really superb. As the bar has floor to ceiling windows, you get a spectacular view of central London. Luke who served us in the evening was also very nice and very friendly, he even made a bespoke cocktail for my friend. Jeevan who is the manager there came and checked on us often. To be fair we were there from 4.30pm - 1am, but even still it was very nice to be checked upon and so looked after by Jeevan. He also gave us a show around of the restaurant and the roof top bar. We will definitely return. The only small feedback would have is to change the olives in the bar, they really did not taste good, they were almost bitter. We had a great evening at Bokan and would definitely recommend to anyone to go there for a drink..friendly staff and amazing views guaranteed!!

Unfortunetly, the service is dreadful. I have never come across such rude staff anywhere in London. My colleague's birthday drinks were totally ruined. The hostess on level 38 was abrupt with no customer skills. I was made feel unwelcome. Bar staff on level 39 were even worse. On several occasions when trying to buy a drink I was totally ignored. After waiting for some time I was told I had to queue somewhere else. No further details were given or explained to me. Buying a drink each time was such a challenge. Settling payments was another issue - each time different prices were applied for the same drink. A tall waiter kept coming to our area throughout the night reminding us how we should have booked a table, despite half of the reserved ones being empty. I don't understand why would you want to turn spending clients away when the place is half empty. The overall experience was very disappointing. As an employee based in Canary Wharf, I was very excited about the opening of this venue. I thought it would be great for team outings, Friday drinks, leaving parties, etc. There is no way I'm coming backing to Bokan and will not recommend to it to anyone in Canary Wharf. When you charge premium prices for food, drinks and service, you just have to do better than my last night's experience."]}

I sat there and thought, this is going to be so good and make up for the experience we have had so far, but\u2026. It was rancid. I don\u2019t know if your bar staff have ever had a pornstar martini anywhere else but I have never had such a sour tasting, dry, small pornstar martini in my life. Even the prosecco on the side was again, extremely dry and sour to the taste. I would never order a Pornstar Martini from here ever again, even worse that one I have had from the likes of Be At One or All Bar One and this is supposed to be an amazing rooftop bar competing with the likes of Radio Rooftop and Rumpus Rooms and it was just not even comparable. Id compare it from my experience so far to my local Weather Spoons.", "Right, ive had enough, we are leaving, attic bar is around the corner and ive been there before and know it is a safe bet. This is me trying to salvage what dignity I have left as I have recommended this to everyone and booked it for a friends Birthday and it was just a shambles. Trying my best to keep spirits high as everyone looks like they have just had enough and want to go home.", "I manage to finally get hold of someone to get my bill as no one is giving eye contact so unless you chase after them, you are out of luck. I hand over this little business card that you get free at the front with a little number on it to get my card back (cant even supply the plastic tabs) and 10 minutes later get my card, and guess what? The completely wrong receipt.", "You literally managed to give me my card back with someone\u2019s else\u2019s receipt order. You can imagine how this looks, you could have given my card to the right person or if I hadn\u2019t have checked it, I would have paid nearly a \u00a3300 bill for my 5 drink order.", "I flag this up immediately to get my correct receipt. With this one I ask politely to take the service charge off my receipt as I refuse to pay 12.5% for what was terrible service. Your waiter comes back with yet another receipt. This time it is our order but there appears to be an extra bottle of Rose wine on there! Again not what I ordered. Like how bloody hard isit to print a receipt out of what we ordered on our tab with our table number? Obviously very difficult.", "This isn\u2019t the end though, here comes the embarrassing bit your end. When she (the original guy was obviously too embarrassed to come over) comes over to take the payment she asks \u2018Why do you not want to pay the service\u2019, I hate to say it as I am not a rude person, but I laughed in her face, I said you cant prepare a table with 5 chairs, cant put correct orders onto a receipt and im surprised I even got my bank card back. And you want me to pay you for this? She stood there stunned and said \u2018the company make us ask\u2019. ", "If this is true then you should be ashamed of yourselves. You charge good money for drinks alone but then expecting me to pay the extra 12.5% for the worst service I have ever received. I have received better service ordering a Bic Mac at 4am. It is up to the people paying if they want to pay service charge, hence why it is optional. To make your staff ask as to why is horrendous, everyone was looking at them and to think that is going to put me on the spot like it would most people, you are very wrong. I raised my voice and explained exactly why as your other customers listened in, in shock.", "I don\u2019t know if this was just a bad experience I had or if this is just what to expect from this place. Big name, great advertising, well set up with amazing views and good money spent on the interior! But as to the service, staff and drinks, unless I see a lot of good reviews go in soon, I don\u2019t think I will be going back or recommending this to any one I know. This just really lowered the mood and pretty much ruined our night when it was supposed to be the highlight!", "I hope your service will improve so no one else experiences what I did on Friday night."]}

It certainly didn't disappoint. Our table was booked for 7.15pm and we were promptly walked to out table. A cloudy day, and what could have dampened the view , soon changed to sun streaming through the cloud to highlight The Shaard and Millenium Wheel, sites we were able to see from our seats at the window table. Although the table had a 2 hour rebooking slot, something made clear in the booking, we were not made to feel as though we had to rush off or that someone was waiting for the table. As for the food. Well this has to be some of the best I have tasted in a while. From the 'amuse-Boucher ' to the main course of fillet steak, all tasted amazing. Will definitely be going back. Will have to just make up a special occasion to justify the visit. The icing on the proverbial cake has to be the roof terrace. The views from here, once evening had taken hold, were amazing. Being a little chilly that evening meant we couldn't spend as much time out there as we would have hoped but in the summer, provided it's not too British, this will be the only place you will want to be."]}

Whilst tourists may stray unwittingly in, locals beware, its not good, for those who think its good value try Roka, Carluccio's, The Parlour, Plateau or The Manhattan Grill to name just 5 for those of you wishing something big and brash try Big Easy those of you who crave a view, try Nelsons column"]}

The staff were really friendly that we decided to book again for dinner. On arrival Andrea and her colleagues were very welcoming ,gave us a great table. We had staters,mains and desert and loved every course. Definitely worth the money (and the view helps) To top it off,the nice waitress (unfortunately did not get her name) heard it was my birthday and went over and beyond and gave me a small cake from Paul and the team. Completely unexpected and just makes us want to come back again!! Next stop the roof top! "]}

It appears the alcohol may have been mixed with a Thames Water special but who am I to say? However they may have been tainted by the terrible service we had received. ", "But fortunately we were compensated - by a small bowl of crisps. No offer of anything else and quite insulting really that it was deemed a bowl of crisps which cost no more then 10-15p at wholesale price was more than adequate as compensation for the 45 minute wait for two drinks.

Thank the lord for that bowl of crisps! ", "So in conclusion if you want to lose water weight before a bodybuilding competition come here.

The singer finished soon after 8pm just as we finished our meal and we moved to the 39th floor for coffee and after-dinner drinks with a nice view over Canary Wharf. When we arrived the music was loud but not completely overbearing. But as our coffee and drinks arrived the music was turned up to a volume where conversation was impossible. We asked if it could be turned down a bit, but were told that it couldn't be. So we quickly finished our drinks, paid up and left.

We selected a very nice bottle of portuguese red and looked at the menu. Some excellent bread was brought to the table. The menu wasn't huge but we both found things we wanted to try. For starter we shared the Bokan board which had a selection of charcuterie, cheese, pate and a scotch egg. The pate lacked a bit of flavour but the scotch egg was perfectly cooked with a runny centre. For main we had the pork belly and venison pie, both were very tasty. The desserts were also very good and beautifully presented, plus good coffee to finish. The service throughout was charming, friendly and helpful. Overall we had a lovely evening. The full price of the meal would be a little high but this is definitely a place to come for a special occasion."]}

The ginger pudding was full of flavour and melted in the mouth. My fellow Diner commentated that it was the best dessert they had had in 20 years.

It's on the 37th floor, accessed by an impressively swift lift to the 38th floor bar and reception area, itself just below the 39th floor roof terrace. Unsurprisingly it's biggest attraction is the view it commands over vast swathes of London and from my seat northwards as far as Hertfordshire. A pity then our view was impeded by the fact we were seated at what seemed to be the only table adjacent not to a window but a metal frame. In addition to the a la carte was a lunch menu featuring two courses for \u00a322 and three for \u00a326. This represented quite a bargain compared with the a la carte many of whose mains (without sides) cost as much if not more than three courses on the set menu. The 50% discount on food as part of the soft launch, however, gave us an excuse to go a la carte. There is no children's menu (indeed my daughter appeared to be the only child dining) but a main of spaghetti with tomatoes and pesto was served with our staters and, as requested, without olives. It was such a substantial dish it kept her occupied beyond the finish of our mains. My wife started with burrata which was suitably creamy although the accompanying crackers were not particularly crispy. My steak tartare was beautifully served on a plate with little spots of dressing but could have had more egg yolk whisked in than I noticed. My main, a poached fillet of cod on a bed of spinach with shrimps covered in a brown foam was a sensational dish, but at \u00a326 at full price perhaps needed to be. My wife's chunks of salmon on green beans looked a little more prosaic by comparison. A ginger pudding we shared for desert hit another high note, but the bitter stewed espressos were fairly horrible. My wife and I are admittedly fussy about coffee but never cease to be amazed by the sheer unpleasantness of espressos served in so many venues in London including those that specialise in coffee such as Caravan who really ought to know better. We enjoyed our glasses of house white until they were shown on the bill as Chablis at a fairly astonishing \u00a39 per glass as opposed to the \u00a35.40 for the eminently quaffable vin du maison. So all in all an accomplished meal not without the odd blip and, in common with the location of the restaurant within the hotel itself, not quite hitting the heights."]}

My starter was ice cold but the plate had been warmed up. For a pea and mint fritter, that gave the game away that they weren't freshly prepared to order. No biggie, but surprised someone would plate up something straight from the fridge and hope that the customer wouldn't notice. ", "We also had some issues with a member of our party who asked what she could have that was gluten and dairy free and offered alternatives or alterations, one of which arrived with dairy fairly obviously (a chocolate souffle that had a big Bokan signature chocolate (dairy) disc on it as one example). There seemed to be some disconnect with what the front of house staff were telling the kitchen crew and what was coming out. ", "With the other dishes, a fish dish was verging on being undercooked. A rotisserie chicken a tad dry on the breast meat section (wonderful flavour otherwise) and pork belly dishes that were well received. Despite these items, we really enjoyed the food. ", "We passed our comments on to staff to inform not criticise as we knew this was the soft opening but we were very keen to go and see this place. The staff were very gracious in their understanding and more than generous in removing items from the bill without us asking for this. ", "I imagine by the time of the official opening all these things will be ironed out and the place will be jumping. The atmosphere was great, matching the view and decor of the venue. The staff are very enthusiastic and provide a fresh venue for locals and wharfers to go to escape the other, sometimes dull, choices available on the main CW estate. Several of my group are considering hiring out part of the venue for parties, so despite the small setbacks on the night we went, we know that this place will be pretty good when it gets into full swing.
