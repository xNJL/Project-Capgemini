We ordered our food from the barman, who came to our table without a pen or paper, so we should have known he might get one of the orders wrong, but he successfully managed to get all 3 wrong!!! Might be an idea to invest in a pen and paper instead of trying to be too clever. My steak when it arrived was disgusting. I could tell it had been cooked straight from frozen and was tough and chewy, which would indicate it had probably been in the freezer for a few months. The salmon arrived and was black it was so overcooked and was extremely dry. Even when the manageress came over to try and rectify the situation, she got our order wrong!!! As I was leaving the manageress did tr and make amends by inviting me back for a complimentary meal and giving me her business card. The fact I have declined to eat there for free should tell everyone all they need t know about the restaurant at Hilton Docklands. It's a real shame as Cinnamon used to be quite good and I would eat there a couple of times a week, but the quality of food and standard of service are dreadful. Without a doubt, the food quality is no better than 2 star, regardless of what star the hotel is. In future if I want a steak I will pop to Goodmans, which is 2 minute walk from the hotel and 200 times better than the Hilton's poor efforts.

146,,"[""We bought afternoon tea vouchers off groupon. This was my first time going for an afternoon tea and was so disappointed. The atmosphere was not relaxed/cosy. It was very modern and upright. They first served the tea and after a while the snacks came. The bread if the sandwiches had gone tiny bit stale which means they'd made it from before. I really liked the Victoria sponge cake and this other thing don't know what it's called but had fruits and jelly in a crust. W another negative thing is they only had time slots between 1-3 which is very odd because that's lunchtime! I have tea around 5. So it was very awkward we couldn't decide if we should have an early lunch. But then we would be too full. When we saw the snacks we were thinking we're gonna wipe it clean but in actual fact it was very filling and we couldn't finish it off had so much left over. Overall I think afternoon tea should be cosier more homey and definitely not at 1pm!!after this o went to another afternoon tea in Scunthorpe called giles absolutely loves it it was very vintage deco everything suited.

My friends and I had purchased group on vouchers in 2012 for the cinnamon restaurant at Hilton Canary Wharf and the vouchers expired in January 2013. This meant that over the festive season of 2012 we were enjoying brunches on a Sunday morning with family and friends and even got to celebrate my son's and dad's birthday together as a family gathering. The deal was £19 for two adults but you could add children at £6 each at the restaurant. "", 'Where do I start? Well the ambiance was fantabulous to say the least, very comfortable furnishings which although classy enough was still very child friendly. The staff could not be more accommodating which is what one would expect from somewhere like the Hilton. They were all so attentive and child friendly. Our party was filled with lots of children and we never once felt the we needed to apologise for this.', 'The food? Well certainly the star of the show. The variety of choices for breakfast was amazing but not just variety and quantity but also quality and well prepared. Then there was the choice of meal from the lunch menu which was like a fusion Asian theme and it did not disappoint!', ""If it was not for the groupon deal I probably would not have been aware of it and without the deal it would have been far more pricey but based on the quality of food, services and ambience I would gladly pay full price to have brunch here once per month. Unfortunately this morning I rang up to book a table for two adults two kids fro brunch and was told that they no longer do brunches, only breakfast. They don't even do lunches anymore. I was so disappointed to say the least. I guess perhaps they were unable to sustain brunches as that side of Canary wharf is not very busy on weekends and they could not keep doing groupon deals. Shame as I've not been able to find anywhere else in South East to do a brunch as good."", ""By the way I've put October 2013 only because they won't allow the date to go back as far as 2012 and I feel it would be an injustice if I didn't write this review even though they no longer do brunches.
