1,,"['Boisdale Canary Wharf is part of a coterie of British restaurants in London, the others in Belgravia, Bishopsgate and Mayfair. It is a large old-fashioned clubby sort of place spread over a corner of the first and second floors within the Canada Place skyscraper. There is a space for live music at the darkened end of the upper floor restaurant with views over Canada Square. The walls are covered with prints and pictures including some striking female nudes. As this is a Scottish restaurant the waitress wears a short kilt, fishnet tights and a sporran. It also comes with a lifestyle magazine for sales of gin and whiskey edited by Boisdale’s founder Ranald (sic) McDonald. That Scottish delicacy of hamburgers features heavily on a menu that probably hasn’t changed much from the 1980s when Boisdale first opened. Without a 50% discount on food it’s all quite expensive, solid rather than inspiring British cuisine whilst being far from a fine-dining experience. Think sausages and mash, steak and chips, bubble and squeak. I started with a suitably retro cocktail with saucy shrimps as well as larger prawns with added shards of lobster on a bed of creamy lettuce and slaw. Probably slightly inferior to an equivalent I recently enjoyed in a fish restaurant in Hull. I followed this with the dish du jour calves’ liver and bacon on a bed of creamy mash. The liver was very slightly more cooked than the medium rare I had ordered; clusters of bacon much more so. Best of all was an iced nougat dessert with blobs of apple purée. There are some beers on draught as well as in bottles but not on an extensive wine list with at least one bottle over the £2000 mark suggesting pretensions that the food simply doesn’t match.']", February 2020,g186338-d2180904-r744514687,g186338-d2180904,[],[],4,12 February 2020,Boisdale_Canary_Wharf,/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d2180904-Reviews-Boisdale_Canary_Wharf-London_England.html,"[['pencil-paper', '2802'], ['thumbs-up-fill', '1252']]","['London, United Kingdom']",futtock21,Upscale McDonalds ,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d2180904-r744514687-Boisdale_Canary_Wharf-London_England.html

I had a portion of steamed broccolli which was ok. A gin and tonic is 11 pounds and water is 4.20 for 75 cl. A Treacle pudding which looked like it was out of a bag was 7.50.

328,,"[""We booked dinner and live music tickets for a Friday Soul Night. Tickets were £39.50 and included a 2 course meal plus a glass of prosecco. We booked our table for 8.15pm and the show started at 9.45pm. I loved the decor and atmosphere and we were given a nice candlelit table near to the front. There are nice views from the window side and you can go downstairs onto the terrace. Food was good and so was the service. But the highlight of the evening was the band - Andy Mitchell and his Big Funk Corporation, an eleven piece band - they were great! They played a really good set with many current songs as well as standards, which was nice. The set lasted 90 minutes and many of us were up and dancing. Do be aware that some of the options on the set dinner menu incur a supplement (e.g. £6 for steak). With desserts, a bottle of wine, a beer and service charge we spent a further £78 which I didn't mind as we were celebrating a special occasion but I wouldn't want to do that every time. Apparently you can also book tickets just for the show and a cocktail at £19.50 each. Would certainly go again. We thoroughly enjoyed the evening.

329,,"[""It pains me to say this will be the last time we visit Boisdale. We've been going to boisdale twice a year for the last six years (summer and Christmas) in the last 18mtns we've seen a significant decline in food, entertainment, beverages and overall standards. We went to see ELVIS on the 5th August which being a massive Elvis fan I was really looking forward to. (Drinks) For a beer drinker like me you usually have at least one run of the mill beers (fosters ,carling,heiniekn) no, only two beers which I've never heard of. (Starters) We used to have a varied choice of starters and if you didn't like what was on offer there was always the good old prawn cocktail which was absolutely superb. (Main course) A fair choice but nothing like it used to be. The menus come on a piece of card, yet in the last five or so years it would have been a leather bound founder with a wider choice of food. The food they do serve is nice and hot and the service is excellent and I wouldn't criticise this at all. (Deserts) Standard deserts but excellent just what we want. (Show) We have seen earth wind and fire, Elvis, rat pack and have always walked away feeling we have been entertained and had a superb night of dining and dancing. (Toilets) Years ago it was always good quality hand wash and paper towels, now we have pound shop hand wash and you rub your hands under the dyson. A clear sign to me it's all about the profits. (Show) As a big elvis fan I thought he was a good singer but the actual show was poor. In the past five years all shows finished between 2345-midnight this night it was 2310, a long time to sit and wait for our cab. (Overall) We have always had a great night at boisdale, it's not a cheap place to go and it can also be a real expensive place if you've had to many beers. We always have the same table close to the stage (table for four at the top of the stairs) which we pay £140 for which on top of the £395 bill is a fair old bill for a night out. At the end of the day you know when the time has come to quit and move on.

351,,"[""I dined here several times with my husband. Steaks are extremely tender, melt in the mouth sort of taste, like no other I have tasted. We dined here on 50% of meals deals sent to me via an email. Otherwise it is a rather expensive restaurant. We have also dined at their Bishopsgate branch, serving equally quality steaks. The sides are rather small and not quite enough. At £4.95 per side is rather a lot for approx. 10 pieces of chunky chips, but nevertheless tasty and well cooked. We ordered mushrooms and broccoli and chips on the side which all come as separate items all at £4.95 a portion, which are all very small but beautifully cooked and served hot and perfect for consumption immediately. Would go again and again as a treat on special occasions and also when sent emails with promotions. They always send me special offers and dates of special quests attending the restaurant and special occasions of Jazz Events. If you stay to dine after 9.30 in the evening you have to purchase a live music ticket or vacate your table. We don't stay for the live music so I can't comment on this. I would definitely recommend this place for quality steak lovers and for celebrating special occasions. Scottish theme throughout, owned by a Scottsman. Menu also Scottish themed. Not suitable/ designed for children, young children anyway, we have yet to see any children there each time we have been there its more catered for Canary Wharf office staff and the older/more mature generation with city pay packets. Drinks are also very expensive, a very extensive wine selection. Soft drinks are also very expensive. They do offer tap water to guests and sliced up sour bread with butter on sitting at the table, which are served fresh and are rather mooorish. We ordered salt and pepper calamari for starters which were £9 for approx. 8 pieces. The steaks were on average £35 with sides extra. All in all a rather expensive evening but well worth it. If you want quality steak, this is the place to visit. Give it a go and enjoy. They also add 12.5% or so tips. If you order the 42 day mature steak you will not regret it. They also do the steak to share for around £70 but again its matured for 42 days and it melts in your mouth.

399,,"['I first visited Boisdale a year ago - as part of two couples celebrating two birthdays. That visit was tremendous, the food was excellent, the service impeccable and whilst expensive - we all felt that it was worth it. However that was then...', 'Late January 2017, to celebrate a birthday - my wife and I decided to enjoy Boisdale once again, believing that the anticipated expense would be worth it as it was a celebration. Unfortunately, the night soundly failed to deliver... There was obviously a private function going on that evening (the night before Burns night?), so the main restaurant never got more than 40% full, however it seemed that the staff wanted to sit all couples next to each other (more on this later).', 'Perhaps it was due to this function that the focus of both front of house and kitchen staff - were focussed elsewhere.', ""The choice of starters was somewhat limited (seemingly a lot of fish - we don't eat), so opted to share a game terrine with foes gras. Unfortunately the fatty fois gras which masked all other flavours except the gingerbread melba toast, so the experience was that of fois gras and not terrine. But it was only the starter - so we weren't overly worried."", ""We followed with two steaks, a medium and a rare fillet on the bone. Unfortunately the medium was rarer than fillet. After some time, we managed to actively attract a member of staff's attention - who took the steak away to be cooked some more. Unfortunately when it had returned, it was evident that it had been now cooked in a pan that had just cooked either heart or haggis from its strong metallic taste, ruining this meat for both diners. The fillet on the bone was unremarkable (so damned by faint praise), the highlight of this course was the sauce diane (and that is not a reason to go to a restaurant)."", 'The desserts were quite nice - a chocolate torte, tasted good but looked fussy. The salted caramel ice-cream was tasty and smooth. However the diners now sitting at the freshly turned neighbouring table had just started on their very smelly fish starter (when they could have been sat anywhere else in the 60% empty restaurant). I am sure that no-one could enjoy a dessert with an all encompassing smell of fish and lemon.', 'Throughout the evening the service was conspicuous by its absence. The staff had no knowledge or joy of the dishes, we had to chase for the steak to be cooked correctly, at no point were we asked if everything was alright, indeed no-one checked if the recooked steak was satisfactory.', ""At the end, we queried the service charge (a restaurant set 12.5%) which was deducted without hesitation. Speaking with the manager, he said the couple were seated next to us as they had decided they didn't want to sit by the stage - surely they could have been sat anywhere else instead (this shows lazy planning and lack of consideration for other diners). "", 'I mentioned that we had returned as part of a celebration, to which the manager told me that I should have told him. Does this mean that Boisdale only gives good experiences to those whom they are know are celebrating a special night. In summary Boisdale charge prices for which one expects (£200 for 2) an excellent experience, one should not need to actively ask for it or justify it. For this price, Boisdale should be delivery a consistent experience to all of the appropriate standard - this evening, Boisdale failed.', ""Can I recommend Boisdale? In all sincerity, I can not - for the price paid, there is no guarantee of consistency. Ultimately, it appears that Boisdale is relying upon the price charged persuading its patrons that it must be good and hoping that others won't complain too much.""]", January 2017,g186338-d2180904-r456674445,g186338-d2180904,"['Value', 'Service', 'Food']","['20', '10', '20']",2,2 February 2017,Boisdale_Canary_Wharf,/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d2180904-Reviews-Boisdale_Canary_Wharf-London_England.html,"[['pencil-paper', '54'], ['thumbs-up-fill', '45']]","['London, United Kingdom']",SimonBP,The danger of second visits,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d2180904-r456674445-Boisdale_Canary_Wharf-London_England.html

Everyone who had the pork or fish dishes said their food was lovely but those that ordered the beef said it was tough and a bit grisly. Considering the beef was priced at a premium, this was very disappointing. The desserts, coffee and drinks were all excellent but the issues with the mains was upsetting, especially as this was somewhere I had chosen for my birthday to celebrate with friends.

It always seemed okay and so with an evening dinner with friends to organise I looked into booking a table for 8 people. At the time that I initially looked into this they had several large round tables available but sadly when I finally got confirmation to book they had already gone. What held me back was that certain table locations warrant a different entertainment price which depending on location and act can vary. Entertainment is optional though, but if you choose not to partake you'll be expected to vacate the floor which may mean a rushed meal. So getting to the point we ended up with a straight table for 8 people at a premium of £20pp for a decent act. The table was half way down the restaurant which wasn't that bad, but I wouldn't say it was the most comfortable I've had, with it being slightly cramped."", ""As for the meal itself, hmmm! Certain dishes were worth the money, others not, with cost outstripping what you actually got on the plate. I personally think a steak should come with at least some veg and not simply on it's own with veg at an additional cost, a venison curry dish was also met with raised eyebrows, the meat content meagre in our personal view. Other than that most other dishes seemed adequate in quantity, but I thought the presentation of my Haggis main was a little poor. For the overall monetary outlay the meal was simply average, it didn't wow you. Saying that I would go again only because the overall experience of meal, entertainment and service was okay. So as the title says i'll swing with it and give it another go at another time, but i'd recommend it to be a consideration for yourself."", ""Just to add, there is no specific dress code, we were smart casual and relaxed formal, but there were also people dressed more glamourously as well as those in jeans and trainers, albeit smart ones.

782,,"['This restaurant was listed as the top place to go in Canary Wharf on several of the local web sites. It is located immediately upon entry into the Cabot Place mall. The restaurant has two floors, the main floor is for casual dining, with primarily the same food, but in a more informal setting.', 'The upper floor is what the service person called ""fine dining,"" and is where the Live Jazz stage is located. We wanted to relax and have a really good meal, so opted for the upper floor. We did not have reservations, but they seated us promptly with a great view of the stage. It all started out very positively.', 'Our server came to take our order, we ordered a Shrimp Cocktail appetizer for each of us and the 7 oz. Filet Steak. We settled in for our perfect meal. The upper floor has great atmosphere and was very busy with what looked to be mostly business men and women. The Jazz was outstanding and they have a different group every night with a brochure of who is coming in the weeks ahead.', 'We got our Shrimp and finished it off, but it appeared that our server once he took the order decided that we were no longer important enough to check back with us, so was left alone for the remainder of the night to flag down other servers and fend for ourselves.', 'Additionally, there were several couples and a large table of diners who came in after us and they all got their meals prior to us getting ours. We wondered why and asked what happened to our food. After about an hour, our food showed up and the steaks were cool, overcooked and generally not very pleasant. Our waiter still had not even thought to look at us or come and ask if all was well, he was too busy taking care of what appeared to be the more important guests.', 'During our wait time, we flagged down several other servers and staff to ask about more water, bread, butter, etc., they helped but we did not get the impression that it was willingly.', 'At the end of the meal, we spoke with the Concierge and explained out frustration. I explained that there were several other diners who came after us and received their dinner either before or just before we received ours. At first he blamed us and said our meal was so very late due to the fact that my friend had ordered his steak well-done, and that if we had ordered an appetizer, it would have spaced the timing so that the steak would be cooked perfectly. After several minutes of discussion on the falsity of that premise and telling him that we did order an appetizer, he recanted and said ""that is unacceptable then, I will have to talk with the Chef.""', ""I think this is one of the nicer places in Canary Wharf, with the Jazz, Cigar Bar and huge Whisky offering, it is perfect for an after work Business gathering to have a few drinks and maybe enjoy a cigar, if that is your thing. I would hesitate to go there and expect a perfect meal experience though, if the Chef can't handle a simple steak I would hesitate to see what he does with the other items on the menu."", 'I must also say that my friend and I, are of a particular ethnicity, I am not sure that that had anything to do with it, but it sure crossed our minds several times during the night, considering we were the only two there of that persuasion.

I would like to say that we are not a steak house rather than a British restaurant that serves excellent steaks, which have been on many occasions commented on by customers as the best they have eaten. Still we serve more than fine steaks and offer a wide variety of seafood and turf equally. As with all foods they are natural product and we do have checks in place to ensure that oysters meet a minimum size, should you have felt otherwise, I always recommend customers to comment on the night so we can rectify a situation then and there to avoid a bitter aftertaste; though I can understand that you chose otherwise. The partridge should have been served with a steak knife to help carve it, however cooking it more has a detrimental effect on texture and taste however I am delighted your guest enjoyed our Haggis. I am delighted you enjoyed the Picpoul de Pinet and agree that the price point is excellent.

When I was told the the Bogus Blues Brothers were playing here, my fist thought was that I really wanted to see them but wasnt sure about if I wanted to pay up for average food again. Given the circumstances, I went for it. It was a fairly expensive night, with the food and drinks bill at £340 for 4 of us but then another £100 for our table as the band was playing. Im still not sure if thats right, but the place was full so I guess its working for them. ', 'First the food... We had Jersey Rocks to start, my wifes favourite oysters. They were surprisingly small, some actually really should not have been served as they were tiny. That sort of soured things a bit for me, My guests had Haggis which was described as excellent and Partridge which was probably a little too undercooked as she was struggling to carve it. My wife and I had the ""special"" Sea Trout, which wasnt. It was really very average and as such very disapointing. ', 'We were recommended a most excellent Picpoul de Pinet which came in at a reasonable £32.50 which was pleasing to see listed. The cocktails were under a tenner which was good but the 15 year old whiskies at £15 seemed a little rich, but i cant complain...They were very good.', 'The band were wonderful and great fun. The room was beautiful, warm red walls, low lighting and candles made for a lovely atmosphere. Sadly, they decided to put the £50 per head tables at the very front , which was fine for them, but at the expense of the dance area which was about 4 sqm. As you might imagine , it got pretty crowded in there. ', 'It has been pointed out to me that generally if you go to a music venue, you should consider yourself lucky if the food is half decent. I dont really consider Boisdales as a music venue , but more a restaurant that has music..As such the food really should be bette rin my opinion. Maybe I shouldnt have such high expectations , it is a great room with fairly priced drinks, which just happens to serve average food.

Unfortunately leaving before the show begins, leaves us with no chance to resell the tickets hence we were unable to offer you a refund.

There are no awkward doors or passageways. The tables are a good width apart from each other and there is a free cloakroom. There is a wide entrance to the disabled toilet, though there is an annoying little ridge to get into the toilet, which takes a bit of force to get the wheelchair over. Sadly, the disabled toilet has been neglected, and was dirty, smelly and unkempt. ', 'Personally, I would visit the oyster grill on the 1st floor of Boisdales sooner than the restaurant.

The haggis is very peppery and seasoned by Macsween. We only lightly season the 'neeps' & 'tatties' as customer's tastes vary. There is a salt & pepper mill on every table. I was sorry that the burger fell so short. The meat is Scottish and of the same quality we use in our steak cuts - the best. Again this often proves to be one of the most popular choices. The menu you ate from is our £19.75 set menu for two courses and burger sales run into the hundreds per week, with over 100 sold as take-away most Fridays.

The chef had managed to achieve a runny white with a firm yolk rather than the other way round, clever – but not very appealing! I was generously offered complimentary desserts in recompense. My main course of Risotto of Broad Beans, Peas and Courgettes was bursting with flavour and colour.

The food was great, as a vegetarian I hate it when the only veggie choices are risotto or something involving goats cheese (SO unimaginative!). Last year the manager went out of his way to arrange an alternative main course which was great. This year was a very different story. The manager was rude, told me that my dish from last year was not on the menu, and that I could have a salad as a main dish (just what everyone wants on a cold winter\'s evening on a special occasion). In the end he ""compromised"" and said they would do a plate of vegetables for me - and that\'s exactly what I got - think a side of vegetables, but spread over a plate. For the type of restaurant that this place portrays itself as being and with a hefty price tag attached for the entertainment and food, this is very poor.

We had cocktails, a bottle of wine, coffees and a cognac: £150. I\'ve definitely had better food for less. But on top of that we had paid £50 for our tickets and here came the really annoying part. Half of the room was clearly not interested in listening to the band and talked all the way through, to the frustration of those of us that did want to listen and indeed to the singer and the band themselves. Even towards the end, when we managed to get the whole room quiet , it became clear there was also a dull roar (coming up through an internal staircase in the centre of the room) from the bar down below.

The House wine list is quite short, and not particularly interesting to be frank. Mark up is 300-400%.

Doubtless the Boisdale would like to assert they are offering a 'discount' for members, but at those mark ups it just feels like a bit of additional fleecing, so we went for a bottle off the House list.

Despite having a table right by the stage, even there one could not avoid an incessant hubbub of loud conversations (which just got louder and louder as people competed with the music), people chatting on mobiles, and the man on the table behind us (who had presumably also paid £120 for him and his wife to theoretically listen to Ruby) talking at full volume non-stop throught the ENTIRETY of the first set. Twice she appealed to the audience, the first time in a light-hearted pleasant way, the second more openly clearly utterly fed up, but there was no respite from the boorish, rude, crass disrespect to a great artist. Oh well, it's money in the bank, what the hell: so understandably the second set was rushed through with as much disinterest as 80% of the audience were paying her.
