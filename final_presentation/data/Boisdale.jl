It is a large old-fashioned clubby sort of place spread over a corner of the first and second floors within the Canada Place skyscraper. There is a space for live music at the darkened end of the upper floor restaurant with views over Canada Square. The walls are covered with prints and pictures including some striking female nudes. As this is a Scottish restaurant the waitress wears a short kilt, fishnet tights and a sporran. It also comes with a lifestyle magazine for sales of gin and whiskey edited by Boisdale\u2019s founder Ranald (sic) McDonald. That Scottish delicacy of hamburgers features heavily on a menu that probably hasn\u2019t changed much from the 1980s when Boisdale first opened. Without a 50% discount on food it\u2019s all quite expensive, solid rather than inspiring British cuisine whilst being far from a fine-dining experience. Think sausages and mash, steak and chips, bubble and squeak. I started with a suitably retro cocktail with saucy shrimps as well as larger prawns with added shards of lobster on a bed of creamy lettuce and slaw. Probably slightly inferior to an equivalent I recently enjoyed in a fish restaurant in Hull. I followed this with the dish du jour calves\u2019 liver and bacon on a bed of creamy mash. The liver was very slightly more cooked than the medium rare I had ordered; clusters of bacon much more so. Best of all was an iced nougat dessert with blobs of apple pur\u00e9e. There are some beers on draught as well as in bottles but not on an extensive wine list with at least one bottle over the \u00a32000 mark suggesting pretensions that the food simply doesn\u2019t match."]}

Our side of garlic & chili mushrooms was also well above normal quality. ", "The dining room wasn't too full but it had a buzzy atmosphere and I imagine it would be a good place to see live music. It was unfortunate that we didn't have much time to spare otherwise I'd have liked to have stayed to see the blues band that was warming up on stage. The tables that don't have a good view of the stage have screens, so everyone can see. Also, the dining room is so large that the music probably won't be overwhelming if you're not there for that.", "The groupon deal is amazing value; it's a great way to discover a place you've never been before. I arrived early so had time to look at the a la carte menu posted outside which offers a good choice, and the cheese trolley looked varied and interesting.

Then the way he treated the manager was just rude - if it was me I\u2019d have told him where to go but Wael the Restaurant Manager went above and beyond to try an resolve the problem. Then to top it all Mr Big and his entourage stood in the aisle dancing and obscured the view.

Previously I have been to Boisdale but didn\u2019t realise that their were multiple levels for dinner and music. On this occasion it was the first floor. It wasn\u2019t as I expected. We accepted that the table location wouldn\u2019t be the intimate setting we hoped for. Starters, good. Waiters checked on us thus far, service was flowing nicely again thus far, good. Heard some RnB playing in the background but thought it was a prelude and the artist of the night would be on shortly as my purchase promised. ", "Mains arrived and it was burnt. We ordered the burger as it was safe. No check backs by waiters kinda told me that, not only they were aware but avoiding what had happened. I didn\u2019t eat it and later told the waiter that finally checked on us later that night. Nothing was done. We advised him to skip desert as it was already going sour in my view. He encouraged us to hang on as we mind change our minds. We didn\u2019t change our minds as the music I hoped for us to enjoy with dinner NEVER came on. ", "Later I approached the till to ask whether I could at least have my desert money back after explaining the situation and was given an outright NO. The guy became so defensive. I even explained that I understood that I should not have waited so long into my meal NOT HAD to mention me being displeased and he shut me down. It was such an unpleasant, UNWELCOMING feeling. So starter good, burnt mains, no dessert, no compensation and a good bye. My service was no longer needed. Oh, and no promised reggae music DJ person which was included in my \u00a329.99. Apparently they were on from after 10pm and not from 0715pm as stated with my purchase. ", "I would never hesitate to mention that after I was treated the way I was, I was offered a card for my next visit to Boisdale for some future compensation, shocking!!!! I asked the gentleman to put himself in my shoes, if you had a dining experience with such poor treatment, will you return? Thanks to him for putting the cider and glass of milk with mint leaf (aka pina colada) on the house but I think if customers views, feedbacks and right to get issues rectified aren\u2019t welcome, then please DO NOT TAKE our monies, and especially if you cannot deliver. ", "Buyers, Boisdale is a beautiful venue for fine dining and fun, lovely music, beautiful ambiance depending on the floor level you select i suppose. I have experienced it previously, 2nd FLOOR ONLY. But unfortunately, this reggae DJ night (which was no where in sight) and Jamaican food situation going on the first floor was delivered poorly. Maybe it was just on our night but the end treatment we were given made us feel so unwelcomed and so \u2018whether or not you return, bothers us not\u2019. "]}

The food was more than adequate service excellent and the pre- dinner cocktail on level 1 was served with a smile and the 80\u2019s decks was great for my age group.

We\u2019re all different ages and generations, Mum/Dads, Nans/Grandads and children so not a rowdy bunch or troublesome group in any way! We pay \u00a330 each just for the breakfast plus additionally a whole day of drinking as well so we spend an absolute fortune with these guys year in year out (easily over \u00a31500 in total).

The breakfast arrived in buffet trays and we were all told to help ourselves like school dinners. There was no toast and when I asked they said that they would see if there was any bread upstairs. They got some bread by which time as all of us had finished. I had a hair in my scrambled egg and they made no effort to apologise they just asked me to help myself to another breakfast from the buffet. I actually asked the waiter if he\u2019d pay that kind of money for a breakfast like that and he said no which says it all really. Then I overheard him telling the manager what had happened and the manager said he didn\u2019t want to talk to me. ", "A bit later on, I ventured out to the road with a glass in my hand which I probably shouldn\u2019t have done really but the TV\u2019s weren\u2019t on and I wanted to see the race considering that it had been such a shambles in Boisdale. I had every intention of coming back up to get another drink and bring the glass back with me too. The manager was in the lift with me and said nothing then as we left the lift he sarcastically barked at me, \u201cEnjoy your glass won\u2019t you!\u201d And walk off the other way. Because of his rude comment, I was rude back to him (perhaps I shouldn\u2019t have but I was just so disappointed that we\u2019d recommended this place to so many people and come back year in year out and spent thousands of pounds here). All he had to do was ask me like normal human being to leave my glass inside and I would have respected his request. No need for him to be sarcastic, very childish behaviour.", "Absolutely gutted and let down but this place which is a real shame. We\u2019ll be finding somewhere else to spend our money next year! Somewhere that actually appreciates us. Absolutely gutted and disgusted with the staff. They made absolutely no effort to help us at all and really didn't care that we're such loyal customers."]}

No one offered us a drink (complimentary or not) or even suggested we have a look at the menu so we could decide what to eat while we waited. The front of house staff could not have cared less. The delay meant that we were eating (what was very mediocre food) as the band performed and therefore not able to get up and dance. Our waiter, who was Brazilian or Portuguese, was great - helpful and very attentive; the only member of staff we came across who was any good. When the band finished the bass beat from the disco on the first floor could be felt through our chairs and totally drowned out the background music in the restaurant.

We chose a bottle of the Navaldar Joven 2016/17 \u00a323.00", "Rioja, Spain. This young Rioja has very intense aromas of licorice & ripe forest fruits. Long & intense wine, with red & dark fruit on the palate & spices on the finish. This compliment ed the meal nicely. When we asked for the bill a 12.5% service charge is automatically added. The service on this occasion was good but feel that tipping should be discretionary."]}

Went to order food and a number of items on the menu was not available? Food arrives but only 3 main dishes turn up, mines not there, I ask the waiter as by then he busy talking to his mate that I have not got my food and he says ( I KNOW!) with gritted teeth. Order second round of drinks , doesn\u2019t turn up, by this point we ask to speak to the manger who\u2019s comes over and say I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ll keep an eye on your table. I think what he meant was he wanted to have a argument. Plates getting slammed down and constant eye rolling. By this time we chose to ignore and started getting up and pouring our own wine as was quicker. We had also noticed that the two tables either side of us were waiting for food and drinks, seemed like there was just not enough staff and apart from one none of them gave a crap and thought it was funny. A little while later the manager came over and kneeled down next to my wife and started whispering in her ear I thought he was saying sorry but in fact he decided to come over and start on her saying what is your problem, if I had known I would have told him to do one. The cocky waiter started being nice when the bill arrived obviously sniffing around for a tip - jog on. We paid the bill minus the service charge as we had no service. On a positive note the Jersey Boys were really good. Shame about the aggressive staff! "]}

It spoils the evening if you have to keep complaining - we did complain but with hindsight not enough! Two of us ordered the Hamburger (I\u2019ve had this before and it was very nice) last night it was half the thickness of previous burger shrivelled up burnt and dry - I couldn\u2019t eat it - the mushroom and bread was ok but \u00a318.75 is a lot to pay for a burger bun a mushroom and a few chips - the message I received was that the Chef agreed it was burnt !! The steaks (ordered 3 rib eyes with a \u00a39 supplement) were thin, very tough difficult to cut and I noticed watching the two men opposite me eating them rather chewy! My other friend sent hers back as she just gave up trying to cut it . After complaining they said they would cancel the supplement and gave us some cheese and biscuits! Desserts eventually arrived - myself and a friend decided on the chocolate brownie, was looking forward to this - well it was not a brownie it was chocolate (sickly) mousse on a layer of chocolate sponge which was about 7mm thick neither of us ate it. I would also add we waited a very long time in between courses, when the \u2018complimentary cheese\u2019 arrived our dessert menus were taken from us but our dessert order wasn\u2019t taken? Eventually we had to ask for the menus to be returned so we could order our dessert? The red wine Vina Amate Rioja not recommended - I have never tasted a bad Rioja until I tasted this one. The venue was quite packed - it seemed they couldn\u2019t cope."]}

There is a wide selection of choices for all tastes on the menu and an immense wine list too. The food was of ample portions and well cooked and presented, again I add you are made to feel important and that as an individual the occasion is for you, fantastic friendly and attentive service.", "I will add & it's not just here, adding the service charge (12.5%) in advance is a pet peeve.

The restaurant's website advertises the seats as being - I quote - \"within 5 metres from stage (full closest view)\", and I when I placed my order, the person on the phone kindly confirmed that the table was going to be \"literally in front of the stage\".

We immediately reported this to the reception staff and we were told that we could stand up and move close to the stage during the performance. Of course, we were not happy at all with this compromise, because WE WERE NOT GIVEN WHAT WE HAD PAID FOR, but we did not want to let this spoil our mood. ", "When the performance started, we got closer to the stage, as we had been told. This was not the most enjoyable experience, and certainly not what we were promised when we bought our tickets, but we thought that it was better than sitting behind three rows of tables and not having a proper view of the concert. (By the way: other fans sitting behind us did the same, so we thought that we could have spent much less money and still see the concert close to the stage!).", "This is where the most upsetting part of the evening began: we were repeatedly told off in quite a rude way by the restaurant staff because we were standing. This impoliteness was absolutely not acceptable. Not only did it collide with the instructions we had received when we were seated, but it had a negative impact on the rest of the evening. We could not enjoy the concert because of the bitterness this whole situation had caused.", "The cherry on top arrived at the end of the dinner, when a waitress came to our table with the bill of another guest who had left the restaurant without paying. We knew him from previous concerts, but this did not mean we had to pay for him! This was not just embarrassing - it was shameless.", "I have written an e-mail to complain about the service and the organisation of the evening and the restaurant manager refused to offer any sort of compensation or even a refund of the price difference between VIP tickets and the seats we were actually given. I believe that a restaurant which aspire to excellence like Boisdale should look after its customers in a more sensible and professional way and take their complaints more seriously.", "The food was good, but on the whole our experience was VERY frustrating."]}

The starters, my husband had the squid and i had the egg Benedict, both starters were incredible, such great quality. This was followed by the amazing roast beef and i had the roast chicken this was amazing, great size portions accompanied by carrots, greens and potatoes! Both white and red wine and prosecco we had were lovely too. We had the Pineapple carpaccio dessert and the Dark chocolate marquise, honeycomb", "& salted caramel, both were incredible but the marquise won! Rich, full of flavour and i recommend to anyone if it's on the normal menu! Both dessert plates had 'Happy Anniversary' written in chocolate on them which made our experience even more special.", "The live jazz band were good but unfortunately seemed pretty quiet!

There was an event going on in the next room which was quite bustling and every time someone came through the adjoining door, the music was slightly drowned out, as it was right next to the stage. There was also a very noisy event coincidental on the floor below (the Terrace, I think) which was so loud and booming, that the floor almost shook and the bass could be heard above the jazz band! The waiter service was very good but they were very quiet, however, I received the wrong food in my starter. The main course 12 hour cooked lamb was tender but overpoweringly herbed and I could not eat it all. Overall, disappointing for a club with such high expectation."]}

Reception was fine, great table overlooking the square and the service was excellent. Not too swift but relaxed enough to have reasonable conversation but at the same time efficient. The atmosphere livens up around 2000 so I would not book for dinner before then unless you simply want dinner and then leave. If you overstay into the music session you will be charged a cover charge which is not cheap at around 25 pounds a head. We booked dinner and a show, it was UKL 44.75 per head excluding drinks. We had a two course meal which was included. We both had the squid deep fried which could have come out of a bag of frozen squid and a steak which was cooked well and along with fries was good. I had a portion of steamed broccolli which was ok. A gin and tonic is 11 pounds and water is 4.20 for 75 cl. A Treacle pudding which looked like it was out of a bag was 7.50. So as you can see this is not a cheap place to be. The total bill as above and service charge added ( its also added to the show price so beware ) was 152.10. I think that is expensive. We could have had a meal and show at Ronnie Scotts for less. The room itself is a good size and sound is good so this is a good venue. Its pub food at fine restaurant prices but if you are happy with that in order to see some live jazz on a Saturday night then I guess it is worth it. We probably would not visit again."]}

We've been going to boisdale twice a year for the last six years (summer and Christmas) in the last 18mtns we've seen a significant decline in food, entertainment, beverages and overall standards. We went to see ELVIS on the 5th August which being a massive Elvis fan I was really looking forward to. (Drinks) For a beer drinker like me you usually have at least one run of the mill beers (fosters ,carling,heiniekn) no, only two beers which I've never heard of. (Starters) We used to have a varied choice of starters and if you didn't like what was on offer there was always the good old prawn cocktail which was absolutely superb. (Main course) A fair choice but nothing like it used to be. The menus come on a piece of card, yet in the last five or so years it would have been a leather bound founder with a wider choice of food. The food they do serve is nice and hot and the service is excellent and I wouldn't criticise this at all. (Deserts) Standard deserts but excellent just what we want. (Show) We have seen earth wind and fire, Elvis, rat pack and have always walked away feeling we have been entertained and had a superb night of dining and dancing. (Toilets) Years ago it was always good quality hand wash and paper towels, now we have pound shop hand wash and you rub your hands under the dyson. A clear sign to me it's all about the profits. (Show) As a big elvis fan I thought he was a good singer but the actual show was poor. In the past five years all shows finished between 2345-midnight this night it was 2310, a long time to sit and wait for our cab. (Overall) We have always had a great night at boisdale, it's not a cheap place to go and it can also be a real expensive place if you've had to many beers. We always have the same table close to the stage (table for four at the top of the stairs) which we pay \u00a3140 for which on top of the \u00a3395 bill is a fair old bill for a night out. At the end of the day you know when the time has come to quit and move on. Thank you BOISDALE for some great nights but goodbye."]}

The service was terrible, We waited and we waited and, eventually, we were served. The drinks that eventually came (cocktails) were all wrong. The starters finally arrived at around 9pm and, before our main meal had arrived, the band came on and it was far too loud to have our dinner at the same time. Even though I had paid \u00a360 for this spot we asked to be moved to another table in the main part of the restaurant so we could talk while we ate our main meal. My steak tartar was, to be honest, awful. The rest of the food was average. Due to the slow service, I had asked for red wine to accompany the main meal well in advance but it never arrived. More cocktails were ordered but they were wrong again. The bill was over \u00a3300 (plus \u00a360 for the premier table) making the total bill for our evening frantically over \u00a3400.

Steaks are extremely tender, melt in the mouth sort of taste, like no other I have tasted. We dined here on 50% of meals deals sent to me via an email. Otherwise it is a rather expensive restaurant. We have also dined at their Bishopsgate branch, serving equally quality steaks. The sides are rather small and not quite enough. At \u00a34.95 per side is rather a lot for approx. 10 pieces of chunky chips, but nevertheless tasty and well cooked. We ordered mushrooms and broccoli and chips on the side which all come as separate items all at \u00a34.95 a portion, which are all very small but beautifully cooked and served hot and perfect for consumption immediately. Would go again and again as a treat on special occasions and also when sent emails with promotions. They always send me special offers and dates of special quests attending the restaurant and special occasions of Jazz Events. If you stay to dine after 9.30 in the evening you have to purchase a live music ticket or vacate your table. We don't stay for the live music so I can't comment on this. I would definitely recommend this place for quality steak lovers and for celebrating special occasions. Scottish theme throughout, owned by a Scottsman. Menu also Scottish themed. Not suitable/ designed for children, young children anyway, we have yet to see any children there each time we have been there its more catered for Canary Wharf office staff and the older/more mature generation with city pay packets. Drinks are also very expensive, a very extensive wine selection. Soft drinks are also very expensive. They do offer tap water to guests and sliced up sour bread with butter on sitting at the table, which are served fresh and are rather mooorish. We ordered salt and pepper calamari for starters which were \u00a39 for approx. 8 pieces. The steaks were on average \u00a335 with sides extra. All in all a rather expensive evening but well worth it. If you want quality steak, this is the place to visit. Give it a go and enjoy. They also add 12.5% or so tips. If you order the 42 day mature steak you will not regret it. They also do the steak to share for around \u00a370 but again its matured for 42 days and it melts in your mouth. Delish, enjoy."]}

The menu has been changed since our last visit, I ordered fillet steak to be cooked well done, and specifically said no red. My husband and friend asked for medium. Husband and friends steak arrived rare and had to be sent back. Mine was ok but wasn't as well done as I would of liked. Small in size and didn't taste as good as previous steaks I have had there. Elvis was good. Lots of people were up dancing. Good atmosphere. Had a good night overall but think food standards are slipping which is a shame as we really like it here. Good for couples or groups of friends/family. Would recommend, only disappointed as we here been many times before and know how good it can be!!! Staff polite and helpful.

However that was then...", "Late January 2017, to celebrate a birthday - my wife and I decided to enjoy Boisdale once again, believing that the anticipated expense would be worth it as it was a celebration. Unfortunately, the night soundly failed to deliver... There was obviously a private function going on that evening (the night before Burns night?), so the main restaurant never got more than 40% full, however it seemed that the staff wanted to sit all couples next to each other (more on this later).", "Perhaps it was due to this function that the focus of both front of house and kitchen staff - were focussed elsewhere.", "The choice of starters was somewhat limited (seemingly a lot of fish - we don't eat), so opted to share a game terrine with foes gras. Unfortunately the fatty fois gras which masked all other flavours except the gingerbread melba toast, so the experience was that of fois gras and not terrine. But it was only the starter - so we weren't overly worried.", "We followed with two steaks, a medium and a rare fillet on the bone. Unfortunately the medium was rarer than fillet. After some time, we managed to actively attract a member of staff's attention - who took the steak away to be cooked some more. Unfortunately when it had returned, it was evident that it had been now cooked in a pan that had just cooked either heart or haggis from its strong metallic taste, ruining this meat for both diners. The fillet on the bone was unremarkable (so damned by faint praise), the highlight of this course was the sauce diane (and that is not a reason to go to a restaurant).", "The desserts were quite nice - a chocolate torte, tasted good but looked fussy. The salted caramel ice-cream was tasty and smooth. However the diners now sitting at the freshly turned neighbouring table had just started on their very smelly fish starter (when they could have been sat anywhere else in the 60% empty restaurant). I am sure that no-one could enjoy a dessert with an all encompassing smell of fish and lemon.", "Throughout the evening the service was conspicuous by its absence. The staff had no knowledge or joy of the dishes, we had to chase for the steak to be cooked correctly, at no point were we asked if everything was alright, indeed no-one checked if the recooked steak was satisfactory.", "At the end, we queried the service charge (a restaurant set 12.5%) which was deducted without hesitation. Speaking with the manager, he said the couple were seated next to us as they had decided they didn't want to sit by the stage - surely they could have been sat anywhere else instead (this shows lazy planning and lack of consideration for other diners). ", "I mentioned that we had returned as part of a celebration, to which the manager told me that I should have told him. Does this mean that Boisdale only gives good experiences to those whom they are know are celebrating a special night. In summary Boisdale charge prices for which one expects (\u00a3200 for 2) an excellent experience, one should not need to actively ask for it or justify it. For this price, Boisdale should be delivery a consistent experience to all of the appropriate standard - this evening, Boisdale failed.", "Can I recommend Boisdale? In all sincerity, I can not - for the price paid, there is no guarantee of consistency. Ultimately, it appears that Boisdale is relying upon the price charged persuading its patrons that it must be good and hoping that others won't complain too much."]}

Mains was the fillet steak - excellent flavours, served as ordered (rare) but rather stringy and definitely on the smaller end of the 10-12oz range at best. Finished with a cheese platter, for which I was not \"happily\" shown the tray by \"dedicated staff\" but was rather presented with a rather boring and conservative choice. The fresh pear turned out to be just two super thin slices.", "Service had difficulties getting their act together with food turning up before the wine for both the starter and the cheese (for whom the accompaniments also took a significant time to turn up). Can't blame the staff for this since they are clearly competent but overloaded - never seen waiters just constantly on the verge of actually running through the restaurant to keep up. This also ruins the cosiness of the place.

They were all offered alternative meat, as the restaurant had run out of chicken, but two declined as were already full from the remainder of the meal but my husband did order the pork. Everyone who had the pork or fish dishes said their food was lovely but those that ordered the beef said it was tough and a bit grisly. Considering the beef was priced at a premium, this was very disappointing. The desserts, coffee and drinks were all excellent but the issues with the mains was upsetting, especially as this was somewhere I had chosen for my birthday to celebrate with friends. I was also surprised that the manager of the restaurant only came over to us on the first complaint about my husband's chicken. The two, later complaints, received no acknowledgment. I would recommend for the lovely ambience, music and mostly the food was good but I think the restaurant is short staffed as our waiter, although attentive as he could be was clearly serving a number of other tables, as were the other staff, and all struggling to keep on top of the demands of good service."]}

The beef is wagyu and the taste is splendid. A couple of lettuce leaves on the base and on top of the burger some mushrooms and a large fried egg, cooked to perfection i.e. white well set and the yolk very liquid. The chips were good. Interestingly they charge \u00a31.50 for mayonnaise but it is homemade with a touch of mustard in it - added a nice flavour to the chips. My companion is Italian and felt the pro seco was of a good quality. The decor is outstanding - lots of tartan around. Live music too, later in the evening - we had a few minutes of a taster as the musicians did a 10 or so minute rehearsal. Then canned music - much of it from the 1930's and 40's - so enjoyed it. We will certainly be returning here to taste other items on their menu. Note that the restaurant does not open for lunch on a Saturday."]}

The menu offered a good choice, but almost all the dishes carried a supplement of up to \u00a38! Plus extra if you wanted sides. I chose for my starter Warm Vichyssoise with pickled St Georges mushrooms, new potatoes and garlic. The soup was fairly tasty with very thin slices of potato, but I really couldn't tell if there were any mushrooms in it at all - St George's or otherwise. I told the waiter and he said he'd tell the chef to put more in next time! There was no feedback from the kitchen though. Generally the food was pleasant but nothing special and the final bill was \u00a3170 plus the \u00a380 we'd already paid. So \u00a3250 for 4 people with very little alcohol seems a bit excessive, considering it was supposed to be a promotional price. The jazz band were entertaining and got people up dancing. Staff were friendly and efficient, and we enjoyed the evening very much. It was our third visit, and we'll probably go again, but really not good value for money."]}

After refusing to provide my card details I was put through to the manager who held the same line. It was only when I explained that in my opinion this is an offensive and money-grabbing practice AND that as one of the most popular reviewers on Tripadvisor in London this is exactly what would be going in my review did she change her tune. I was told that this policy is aimed at corporate clients and because we were just a small, private group they could waive the policy. ", "On the night we enjoyed the cocktails but the food was very pedestrian. Five of us paid \u00a3260 for 8 cocktails, 3 steaks, 6 tapas plates, 3 desserts and a coffee. To me this was not value for money: the service was slow, atmosphere pretty bland as we were stuck in a far corner and the quality of the food really wasn't anything special. Such a shame as I had high hopes based on a lovely dinner here nearly 4yrs ago. I may give Boisdale one more try but if it doesn't live up to it's reputation AND provide good customer service, I won't bother to come back. London has lots of wonderful restaurants that are hungry for success and are keen to treat customers well. I'd rather spend money in those."]}

Rib of beef cooked perfectly for me (very rare at my request) and pork shoulder with cracking plus HUGE Yorkshire puddings!!!!!! The wine flowed, the cheeseboard arrived and our amazing waiter Tim was kind enough to give me a small sample of some of the cheeses to help me with my choice. More wine flowed and we ended up with a two day hangover, missed a train stop and a lost phone!!! If Carlsberg did Sunday lunches this would be it!!! Many thanks to the wonderful Tim and his extensive knowledge and humour! We still can't believe one glass of vintage whisky is as much as \u00a32700!!!!! Sunday lunch..... Highly recommended, can't wait for the next time... Minus the lost phone xxxx "]}

It always seemed okay and so with an evening dinner with friends to organise I looked into booking a table for 8 people. At the time that I initially looked into this they had several large round tables available but sadly when I finally got confirmation to book they had already gone. What held me back was that certain table locations warrant a different entertainment price which depending on location and act can vary. Entertainment is optional though, but if you choose not to partake you'll be expected to vacate the floor which may mean a rushed meal. So getting to the point we ended up with a straight table for 8 people at a premium of \u00a320pp for a decent act. The table was half way down the restaurant which wasn't that bad, but I wouldn't say it was the most comfortable I've had, with it being slightly cramped.", "As for the meal itself, hmmm! Certain dishes were worth the money, others not, with cost outstripping what you actually got on the plate. I personally think a steak should come with at least some veg and not simply on it's own with veg at an additional cost, a venison curry dish was also met with raised eyebrows, the meat content meagre in our personal view. Other than that most other dishes seemed adequate in quantity, but I thought the presentation of my Haggis main was a little poor. For the overall monetary outlay the meal was simply average, it didn't wow you. Saying that I would go again only because the overall experience of meal, entertainment and service was okay. So as the title says i'll swing with it and give it another go at another time, but i'd recommend it to be a consideration for yourself.", "Just to add, there is no specific dress code, we were smart casual and relaxed formal, but there were also people dressed more glamourously as well as those in jeans and trainers, albeit smart ones. And once the entertainment is in full flow conversation becomes a bit of an issue if you're intent on chatting rather than listening to the music. Oh and they need to learn what a Floater Coffee is, I can't describe what I got."]}

When it arrived if was difficult to cut and very chewy! A pot of roast potatoes came separately with the meal and other vegetables were delivered to the table but without serving spoons.

We enjoyed G&T's while we chose our food and wine. I had the dressed crab which was light and delicious, and hubby had the Haggis with a noggin of whisky. Igor, our amazing waiter, popping up every now and then to refill our wine glasses. For main course I had the salmon with squid and chorizo risotto. It was cooked to perfection and incredibly tasty. I ordered buttered baby potatoes to go with it but needn't have bothered as the dish was beautiful enough on its own. Phil had ribeye steak which tasted amazing, was cooked exactly how he'd asked and just melted in his mouth. We finished our main courses just in time for the band to start playing. Iain Mackenzie and Swing City, a Sinatra and friends tribute band. They were brilliant! We ordered a selection of cheeses and more drinks which we enjoyed listening to the band. We had the BEST night!! The food was great, the band was great, the drinks were great, the bill was a pleasant surprise and Igor was better than great :)) It's lovely to go somewhere and not have to think about whether you fancy another drink because your waiter pre-empted you! ", "To eat in a lovely restaurant while listening/dancing to a live Swing band is something that is on my bucket list, and now I can tick it off. Pleased to say I don't think we could have chosen a better place and have to say that Igor made it even better. Thank you Boisdale, two very happy customers! "]}

Delicious food, attentive service and lovely wine. My husband and son and I had been to Boisdale, always on a Monday evening. This was now our 3rd time. The first 2 times we simply booked our table online, there were no \"tickets\" to buy. We had lovely seats and enjoyed the music However, this time, we were required to buy a ticket for a table. We chose the 14.50 GBP per ticket price for a guaranteed seat. The other 2 Monday nights when Eric Ranzoni played, we did not have to buy any tickets. So we asked the manager to clarify, as the artist last night was no better than Eric - it wasn't a \"special\" concert that would warrant an extra 14.50 per person. He basically said he would never pay 14.50 on a Monday night as it is quiet, and we should have just \"turned up to get the best seat.\" I believe we should have been credited that 58.00 GBP's - especially with spending over 335.00 GBP's for dinner! Not good customer service at all from the manager!!"]}

Following our meal our service stopped. we served our own wine and if we wanted a drink tried to order from a passing waiter which meant it did not turn up.

In the bar when we arrived there were 4 or 5 staff and none said hello or took our drinks order. When they eventually did the barman didnt seem to know how to mix a Cosmoplitan and took ages. Dirty glasses were not cleared away from where we were sitting even thugh we were the only people in there. In the restaurant, our order was taken by a stroppy waiter. Ten minutes later he returned to say they did not now have the dish my friend ordered. Twenty minutes after that they came to say they had run out of my dish as well. I complained and they gave me another main course for free. The steak was probably the worst i have ever had. All vegetables and even potatoes are extra cost. The singer was nice, A bit twee.

Buddy whittington and his band were amazing. Boisdale definitely attract the best talent. The cocktails were made perfectly, the whisky and rum selections were delicious and so was the wine. The atmosphere was truly unique and took my to the live blues albums i have listened to over the years. Be warned..... This is not a cheap night (\u00a3300 plus.....).

The dining area itself is a truly stunning set up, full of buzz and atmosphere, with efficient waiters darting about. Then the food... absolute top quality... the Rib Eye Steak was divine. But to top it all, there's entertainment from 9.30 pm and an area in which to dance to set the evening off. Yes, it's expensive... But it's definitely worth it. An evening you won't forget. PS.

Great service and amazing food - though not at all cheap! One downside was that, despite their extensive whisky collection, they didn't have either of the ones that my partner asked for.

We booked our meal for 7pm, I had the terrine with Foie Gras to start with, I must say I was not impressed with that, husband had oysters which were extremely good. For main course I had the chicken dish which was gorgeous and husband had the fillet steak which was one of the best he'd eaten. Service was outstanding, the waiter was so attentive even taking our wine down to the cigar lounge for us so hubby could relax with a nice cigar before the entertainment started, the cigar bar is fantastic. The entertainment was outstanding, brilliant entertainers and a lot of people ended up dancing! We are even talking about going again next year.

The food was excellent (only small gripe was that they bought the courses out to quickly) but think this was maybe because once the singer started doing his thing, the whole place was up and dancing which I guess made it difficult to navigate the restaurant with trays of food. Would like to add there was the most extensive and fabulous cocktail list (Yes I tried one or two) and the biggest selection of whiskeys I have ever seen.

As you might imagine , it got pretty crowded in there. ", "It has been pointed out to me that generally if you go to a music venue, you should consider yourself lucky if the food is half decent. I dont really consider Boisdales as a music venue , but more a restaurant that has music..As such the food really should be bette rin my opinion. Maybe I shouldnt have such high expectations , it is a great room with fairly priced drinks, which just happens to serve average food. Nothing wrong with that I guess."]}

I guess over the years i have become spoilt buy Goodmans because the food there is always first class.

My colleage went for medium rare , which I have always been advised not to do with this cut as the extra cooking produces more flavour from the fat. As such I opted for medium. This as it transpired was a massive mistake as it was overcooked, dry and a little cold. As my colleague was happy with his rarer one I did not send it back...but it resulted in a very indifferent meal. The creamed spinach turned up as wilted instead, which again wasnt the end of the world.", "It could have been just an off day so I am not making this an offical complaint more of a niggle...The wine list was excellent and offered a great range of wines and prices, something I always approve of. ", "Its a nice restaurant..and on a summers day, I might be tempted to return, but in all honesty, if I want a steak...Its Goodmans every time."]}

Worth mentioning is the roast served with lovely well cooked vegetables, delicious pudding and a truly sublime English Cheeseboard selection from a well stocked trolley.

My main selection was the crab linguine which i was very much looking forward to. What came out was a tasty sauce although very thick and one piece of crab sitting on the pasta. My partner went for a second choice potted smoked mackerel which was standard followed by salmon which could have done with more flavour.

It was probably the worst quality meal I have ordered and tasted at a restaurant - the bun was burnt and tasted cheap, again, very much as if someone had taken it from a packet. The burger was incredibly, incredibly ordinary - I have tasted far better in Wetherspoon's and even in Burger King; the chips were just bland oven chips with nothing to get excited about at all. It was astonishingly poor quality - I can't quite believe they would serve this in Canary Wharf. My friend had the chicken, which was also astonishing bland with watery side dishes.", "We didn't bother with desert due to the extraordinary low quality of the food. We had another glass of wine and watched the band who were very good and the best thing about the whole evening. We voiced our concerns at the end of the evening and we were refunded one course, which was appreciated but the whole evening left a very sour taste in our mouths. We travelled a long way from the Kent area on the promise of the table and goody bag, but it felt like a huge con - if the food had any kind of quality, it would have been worth it but it really was much worse than you can get in any chain pub.", "Overall, I certainly wouldn't return or recommend it to any others. Extremely disappointing that a restaurant, which clearly has delusions of grandeur, can't even get the most basic of things right; there can't be many worse places to go in terms of service and food in Central London."]}

Today I am being told the restaurant has been booked out for months, this is completed untrue as I recall the conversation quite clearly and if the restaurant was booked out for months why was there no mention when I called on 24th October?. Quite frankly this is appalling customer service from yourself. Just to make you aware I have previously made a booking for 12 + people and never had to complete a form it has always been done over the phone. I do not want to be told by your member of staff - who has made an error that she appreciates what I am saying - when completely she is covering her own mistakes as you have received a booking for the whole night and have not bothered to contact us to cancel our booking. Also, to be told that maybe I was enquiring when I called. I know what my intentions were when making the booking - the difference between a confirmation of a booking and an enquiry. Your staff need to be clear what the process is in a booking and cannot make it up as they go as and when it suits them. Nothing more than a shambles of a service!"]}

Everyone looked fantastic under the lighting and backgorund deep rich colours. The service was superb, friendly, smiley and knowledgeable. The drinks list was equally impressive. The food arrived well presented, smelling great and tasting just right. the only downside was that the portions were not as big as I would have liked. The live music made everything feel real and special. The musicians were entertaining and skillful. They made us smile, grow closer, wonder in amazement and forget where we were!

As the bar tender constructed my Jimmy Roosevelt cocktail I found myself distracted by the magnificent crustacea display behind him. The Oyster Bar & Grill offers an extensive menu of shellfish, caviar, steaks, burgers and sandwiches. We sipped our pre dinner drinks seated on the Cigar Terrace overlooking Cabot Square. We don\u2019t smoke, but having peeked into the impressive Cigar shop we almost wished we did! But a 1988 Vintage Cuban Cigar would set you back a smoking \u00a3275.00 \u2013 enough to burn a hole in anyone\u2019s pocket! We returned to our seats in the restaurant upstairs, passing one or two stag\u2019s heads on the way. Live music was provided by a young Cornish singer songwriter, Jessica Sweetman who was obviously inspired by the likes of Stevie Nicks. The waiting staff were attentive, but not intrusive. The food and wine were excellent, although I had a little gripe about my poached egg that was served with the gravadlax. The chef had managed to achieve a runny white with a firm yolk rather than the other way round, clever \u2013 but not very appealing! I was generously offered complimentary desserts in recompense. My main course of Risotto of Broad Beans, Peas and Courgettes was bursting with flavour and colour. My husband had the Mini Roast Macsween Haggis with mashed potatoes and bashed neeps for his starter and the Wester Roast Poached Salmon for main \u2013 both of which were beautifully cooked and presented. We didn\u2019t try anything from the remarkable display of whiskies which range in price from a reasonable \u00a37.00 for a 50ml measure of Famous Grouse to a staggering \u00a3755.50 per 50 ml measure of Glengoyne\u2019s 40 year old malt! Maybe next time.", "In summary, The Boisdale Club is an ideal venue for meeting up with friends in relaxing, yet extravagant surroundings. Enjoy Scottish fare, fit for a Laird! With live music and great service it provides a great evening out."]}

Service: spot on; attentive without being sycophantic, food and drinks were delivered in a timely fashion. Entertainment: Leigh Coleman was a gifted singer and musician. His set engaged us from 2130 until 2330 (ish). Drinks: The Chilean Sauvignon Blanc was zesty and certainly palatable (had a couple of bottles). However my Martini was a bit of a let down, wrong glass and olives on the side; perhaps I had been spoilt by the earlier one in The Plateau (now that was a special Martini) and perhaps I should have said something at the time, but did not want to start the evening on a downer. Food: Average at best. The Venison Carpaccio was OK. My wife's Warm Fig and Goats Cheese was well received. Her Chilli Crab Linguine seemed to hit the spot but I get the impression the chilli won the firefight against the crab in the flavour stakes. My Fish Pie was certainly on the well done side if not over-cooked. Ingredients were all there (inc the quails eggs) but expected better at the price. The side of Cabbage and Chorizo was insignificant in quantity and indifferent on quality; the sausage won out against the veg regarding flavour. So - would I go again? Perhaps but probably unlikely. Was it worth what I paid (inc premium(?) seating? - I think not. In a nutshell - good service and some good tunes mitigated an average-at-best dining experience."]}

However, we found the dance floor in front of the stage confusing, especially as it may have meant paying for premium seating only to have a bunch of folk 'dad dancing' right in front of your view of the band (luckily we were on the side so were not really affected but if we had been seated a few tables across, this would not have been good). Being used to Ronnie's, we found the amount and volume of chatter from diners as the band drew breath to move on to their next song rather disrespectful and disappointing. Worse, the band (who were clearly a group of very talented musicians) seemed to change their set as they went along to reflect what people who were in that night were dancing to. By the time we'd got to \"Tequila\" and \"Don't Mess With My Toot Toots,\" we felt like we were at a hideous wedding and were ready to leave.

We booked our table probably a bit too early (7.00) but staff were happy for us to order cocktails and eat slightly later. There is a charge per person to book a table which in effect is the cost of your entertainment. At \u00a340 for the best table/seats this is reasonable by London standards for a class act. We were entertained by the Callum big band - some wonderful musicians playing great arrangements of Rhapsody in Blue and West Side story. The cocktail menu is a little heavy on the ginger for me but suited the others on the table - they were strong, yummy and under \u00a310 each. Continuing on the alcohol theme - there are some surprising finds on the wine list, featuring wines from small vineyards like \"little Beauty\" a Gewurtztraminer from New Zealand managing to be sweet and yet dry at the same time and just bursting with flavour. A red wine from the Lebanon was a good contrast with a noise giving hints of cigar (quite appropriate for a venue with a whiskey/cigar theme). There are plenty of staff buzzing around creating a busy atmosphere - it's always good to see a happy rapport between staff as well as towards their customers. Service is efficient - staff happily topping up your water glass (with tap as well as bottled water as requested) without being asked. Food wasn't wow factor for me, but it was good - the scallops and black pudding were fine, the turbot in a homemade batter, whilst crispy on the top was soggy and fatty underneath - but the fish inside was lovely. The fillet steak was cooked very well, and couldn't be faulted. Thanks to the lovely waiter who served cheese to one member of our table (putting up with comments from the rest of us) - he knew his stuff. The cheeses were exciting and generous portions - there was enough for 3 of us to \"taste\" each of the five selected and still some left for the person who actually ordered it. All in all, its a great venue for a good night out."]}

The shellfish bisque that was ordered by four out of the six of us was so far over-salted that it was unbearable. All four diners sent their soups back to be replaced by four fresh versions that still were on the salty side. I can understand if one person's salt preference is more on the bland side, but for four people to all comment in similar fashion is more than just personal taste. My steak tartare was as expected, given that the preparation and seasoning is done by myself rather than pre-prepared by the chef.", "Fish & chips as a main course was very good - a huge chunk of lightly battered fish with plentiful chips. The \"untrimmed rib of beef on the bone\" (\u00a325) sadly was offered not such complimentary comments. Flavour-wise, the beef was a little bland and could have done with a bit more seasoning (in strange contrast to the bisque before!) but what is totally unforgiveable is the poor quality of the meat itself. Cooked medium rare to medium, the meat was almost impossible to cut with a steak knife, being far too stringy and tough. The fat simply had not rendered anywhere near enough, even though the steak was of thick-enough stature to allow the fat to melt away without overcooking.", "In comparison to Hawksmoor (which I have just reviewed), Boisdale is a good deal cheaper but on the evidence of this visit, it needs to up its game quite considerably to be acceptable in standard."]}

The views were very good looking out over canary wharf, with the rest of the club tastefully decorated with various art etc, stylish. The service was spot on ,as was the food, nothing to much trouble for the waitress who looked after us very well. fantastic wine list, wines to suit every taste at reasonable prices. Great music venue as well , great band , great atmosphere . Also had a cocktail in the bar which is down below the restaurant that was lovely as well.

The majority of us chose Haggis for starters, only to be told they had 'run out'. The steak I received for my main course was largely made up of fat (a large amount of weight the steak claimed to be) and did not come as requested it to be cooked. The side dishes were a laughable size but were probably the best thing about the meal. Service was average and dining was slow, we waited a long time for our food to come out. Music was ok, but more of a gimmick than entertainment. Sadly another restaurant you pay the price to eat in a nice location not the quality of food. Overall I would NEVER go back or recommend to anyone... Should have gone to Goodman's or Hawksmoor!"]}

We had arrived early because we wanted to eat before the entertainment began, only we didn\u2019t realise we would have a 3 hour wait!

The vegetables were interesting, I had broccoli with lemon juice and almonds and he had cabbage with onion and mushroom. ", "The cheese trolley \u2013 what can I say?? I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. It must have been 3\u2019 in diameter and full of the most wonderful cheeses including Lancashire Bomb (black, spherical and full of crumbly Lancashire cheese) and Stinking Bishop.

(Note to the Boisdale \u2013 can\u2019t you manage this in some way?? I\u2019ve been to jazz clubs where the management challenge noisy customers. Why should we pay a helluva lot and not be able to hear properly?) Oh, and the acoustics aren't brilliant either, but I was prepared to overlook that. ", "And the goody bag?? Well it contained a \u00bc bottle of Canard Duchene champagne (no rubbish here, obviously!), a miniature of Chivas Regal, a tiny bag of posh chocs and a CD of Cuban music. ", "Would I go again?

The total bill for 4 of us with two bottles of wine was \u00a3107.00, which was with 50% off food. The service was ok but nothing special. All in all nothing to write home about."]}

The menu has all the Boisdale standards but we went for a traditional Christmas menu, which was excellent value. The portion size was generous, this was no wafer thin turkey slices but good hefty carvings and extra veg was brought out for the table, all was beautifully cooked. our lovely waitress of the day took great care of us and stayed smiling till the end ... The wine menu was extensive and covered every part of the globe and every sized wallet. By the time we finished it was early evening and although the staff need us to move on by then we were never rushed. Drinks back in the now crowded but happy bar brought the festivities to a close.

The food was great, as a vegetarian I hate it when the only veggie choices are risotto or something involving goats cheese (SO unimaginative!). Last year the manager went out of his way to arrange an alternative main course which was great. This year was a very different story. The manager was rude, told me that my dish from last year was not on the menu, and that I could have a salad as a main dish (just what everyone wants on a cold winter's evening on a special occasion). In the end he \"compromised\" and said they would do a plate of vegetables for me - and that's exactly what I got - think a side of vegetables, but spread over a plate. For the type of restaurant that this place portrays itself as being and with a hefty price tag attached for the entertainment and food, this is very poor. I don't think they will see us again in 2013 for what seemed like it could have been an annual event."]}

Starter was amazing (haggis, neaps and tatties - it does have a Scottish theme after all) and portion sizes were perfect.

My partner ordered from the cheaper \"Jacobite\" menu whilst I went a la carte. Both our starters were good - Colchester oysters and the potted mackerel. The mains less so - an indifferent burger and a very small portion of plaice in a strangely bitter sauce. We had cocktails, a bottle of wine, coffees and a cognac: \u00a3150. I've definitely had better food for less. But on top of that we had paid \u00a350 for our tickets and here came the really annoying part. Half of the room was clearly not interested in listening to the band and talked all the way through, to the frustration of those of us that did want to listen and indeed to the singer and the band themselves. Even towards the end, when we managed to get the whole room quiet , it became clear there was also a dull roar (coming up through an internal staircase in the centre of the room) from the bar down below. My advice - if you want a venue in London to watch jazz: go to Ronnie Scotts, the food is better and you can hear the music properly. If you go to Boisdales, go for the view and eat from the Jacobite menu - its better value for money."]}

Not, I hasten to add, with the venue itself. We were driving, and for London the parking at Canary Wharf is surprisingly cheap. If travelling by the Docklands Light Railway one can walk off the platform, go down an escalator, and be in the Boisdale in about a minute. ", "Very swish and well appointed, the food was excellent - which it should be for the price. Starters, the potted shrimps and the crab tian, were very pleasant. My rump steak was absolutely excellent: tender, exceedingly well flavoured, and cooked spot on for the 'rare' requested. Best steak I've had anywhere since a meal at Gaucho's last year. Mrs P's langoustine main was very nice she assured me. The only fault - a minor one - was in one of the sides: the mushrooms were somewhat over-cooked.", "Drinks are on the expensive side. The House wine list is quite short, and not particularly interesting to be frank. Mark up is 300-400%. However the rest of a very lengthy list has two prices: one for members, and another with a hefty surcharge for everyone else. Doubtless the Boisdale would like to assert they are offering a 'discount' for members, but at those mark ups it just feels like a bit of additional fleecing, so we went for a bottle off the House list. It was nothing better than ok, and not worth the price charged.", "We'd missed Ruby Turner's recent sessions at Ronnie Scott's, with all three evenings sold out. But here was an opportunity to catch up with one of our favourite artists, a British R&B and Soul legend for around 35 years. And now we come to what has me seething still: the clientele. Despite having a table right by the stage, even there one could not avoid an incessant hubbub of loud conversations (which just got louder and louder as people competed with the music), people chatting on mobiles, and the man on the table behind us (who had presumably also paid \u00a3120 for him and his wife to theoretically listen to Ruby) talking at full volume non-stop throught the ENTIRETY of the first set. Twice she appealed to the audience, the first time in a light-hearted pleasant way, the second more openly clearly utterly fed up, but there was no respite from the boorish, rude, crass disrespect to a great artist. Oh well, it's money in the bank, what the hell: so understandably the second set was rushed through with as much disinterest as 80% of the audience were paying her. She could not wait to get off the stage, with several numbers curtailed from their usual length, and justifiably did not return to provide an encore.", "One might say that people, having paid their money, can do what they want; but for the life of me can't see why so many doubled the price of their meal just to talk over the act.", "Of course it may have been a one off, but not giving it a second chance to have an evening ruined: never bothering with the Boisdale for a musical dining event again."]}

I pre-booked our table via web page for ( 2 Dec) gbp20 pp. The set menu is a little limited I had the lambs lettuce and salad cream(that\u00b4s all it was!) thena burger which was ok ! my husband had ravioli and steak with a lovely mushroom sauce (not on set menu) you have to order a side dish seperately !we enjoyed a bottle of merlot and a cheese board and cocktails to finish. The service was good and it should be! we noticed when re returned to our hotel that we paid 12.5% 16.76 for (optional) service charge !! on our 134.10 dinner. I think is a little expensive with booking fee as well. I would like to add that we loved the music but the audience didn\u00b4t pay much attention to the band due to dinner being served throughout which I thought was a little rude and a shame because it was great music. We come from Barcelona and this would go down a storm but half the price !!!"]}
