Although not strictly kosher, it epitomises classic traditional old fashioned Jewish cuisine, Whereas most other Jewish restaurants these days tend to do middle eastern type food rather than timeless dishes like these. Since Blooms closed down, there is nowhere to go for decent chicken soup and matzoh balls, kreplach, chopped liver, hot salt beef, tongue, viennas, and all the classic vintage Hebrew delights that I so loved while growing up. This wonderful restaurant run by John and his sister in law, Gina brings back the taste of my youth, the fondly remembered delicacies of yester year.. Everything is perfect, the incredible service dished up with warmth and charisma, the taste of the food, which dances a tango on your taste buds, the best salt beef outside of the Stage Deli in New York. Blooms was never perfect and its memory pales into insignificance when compared to this truly rare find. Whatever else do do, try the hot salt beef sanwich - WOW - indescribable. It fills me with joy that such a restaurant like this can still exist in 2020."]}

As an example, my friend and I had Prawn Tamarind (giant grilled prawns served on a bed of crispy noodle topped with an exotic sweet and sour tamarind sauce), which were delicious. I inquired of Arm, our friendly and helpful waiter, whether they could replace the tamarind sauce with lemongrass, chilli and garlic sauce. He confirmed that would not be a problem. I also asked if they could cook steamed sea bass, which is currently not on the menu. Again he answered in the affirmative.", "Niyom's flexible approach in customising a dish to the diner's preference is refreshing and, indeed, worth pondering.", "All in all, we had an enthralling eating experience on our return visit this lunch time and look forward to the next one with anticipation."]}

As I've said I'm no regular customer but the food was delicious as before. I know it's maybe not hard to do ribs, but consistency is as we all know and the menu and food still is. How many burger joints open and close in bromley, I think Madisons is over 20 years strong if I remember rightly. It still has the same character, quality, and cleanliness I remember. Might sound strange ( I am) but If you try it just look at the $1 dollar bill's (notes) signed by hundreds of previous customers then placed on the walls. They still look brand new!"]}

There is so much wrong with these places that I don't know where to start. These places purport to offer food which is \"Punjabi\" or \"Tandoori\" which is the north Indian cuisine. It is nothing of the sort. I should know, I was born and lived in Amritsar, and this annoys me.", "Therefore, like any self-respecting Indian, I don't generally go to 'Indian' restaurants in London and prefer to cook at home, where the labour is rewarded with the aforementioned authenticity. ", "The exceptions to this (sometimes) are south Indian restaurants who's cuisine has escaped the Bangladeshi grip, or else some 'fine dining' places uptown where you will get good food, but served in a European fashion in very small portions with Michelin star attached. I often feel I could have stayed at home, served my own food on a smaller plate, and set my wallet on fire instead. Therefore my Indian 'fine dining' exploits are rare, mostly because I don't like venturing into the West End just for dinner, but also because I have run out of organs to sell.", "Going to Southall, Tooting or Hounslow is also not an option for me. These places can offer decent food, but the rest of the experience makes you want to just eat and leave.", "Enter Little Mumbai which is an antidote to this. We want something which is cheap enough to visit often without having to sell our children. We want something honest, true to the flavours of India, and smart. But not too smart; I don\u2019t enjoy myself properly when visiting places where others have dressed up to go out. ", "As its name suggests, it\u2019s not Punjabi, but the Punjabi staples are all present and correct. It offers this alongside Bombay street food, which is something most curry lovers won\u2019t recognise. It\u2019s hot, sweet, tangy, and sour all at the same time, and I fell in love with the excellent Chowpatty Platter which is a medley of four classic street favourites. The simple Pani Pooris are also brilliantly executed. These can be followed by all things recognisable to the curry lover, but delivered with finesse which puts some of the uptown expensive joints to shame.", "The service is excellent. The wines are excellent and affordable. The prices make it worth visiting often.", "This place is not for the curry lover who has adapted to the English influenced Ago-Bangla nonsense pedalled in practically every other suburb of the United Kingdom. It's for those who want to be reminded of India, or those who want to be enlightened.", "I was tempted not to write this review, since I rather like keeping this place a secret, but I would be doing humanity a disservice. We need more restaurants like this in London."]}

I remember when they didn\u2019t have any draught beer! That was a big upgrade in my opinion. A mix of classic and classic with a twist cocktails are done well also. If Gordon Ramsey ate at Carved, he would say the food/drinks/overall brand is executed brilliantly 100%. I\u2019m no chef or restaurateur but I think Carved is so Franchiseable. Recommendation for patrons: O.G burger with a Camden Hells. Advice to Carved: Fish tacos all year round.", "Ps.

We were the first customers there having arrived at 18:00 when they first opened for the evening. A waiter appeared from behind the counter and went to check with an older gentleman for available tables (we hadn\u2019t booked), the waiter was just handed a phone by the gentleman and told to take an order so we were left standing in an empty restaurant for a few minutes wondering what to do. Finally we were seated in the middle of the restaurant but we asked to move which they were fine with but it was made clear other tables were booked. Another couple arrived soon after us also without booking and it was touch and go wether there were any tables available for them, they also had it made clear that other tables had been booked, they were eventually seated next to us. Very soon the restaurant was nearly full and there was a delay getting our order taken, eventually we placed our order. Food was very good indeed, I asked for mine to be slightly more Spicey than the standard but my curry eating all over the world must\u2019ve dulled my sense of spice so I should have asked for even more. Rice tasted nice and fresh and not left over from the lunch time like some restaurants might do. It was hard to get someone\u2019s attention to ask for the bill but eventually it came. The 10% optional service charge is clearly shown on the bill and although we didn\u2019t mind paying the full 10%, there was a mistake in our change but the young waitress candidly admitted to being \u201crubbish at maths\u201d (and clearly she was) so this made the whole paying experience more painful than was necessary. To summarise, it\u2019s best to book, food is good, the young waiters all seem to try hard but it\u2019s clear they are all either very new to the industry or need more instruction and guidance, as does the older gentleman who might be the owner and may be best suited back of house."]}

In the event, the tasting menu was not accessible (mix of meat, fish and veggie) and the a la carte menu only had one veggie option as a starter and one as a main course. ", "What went well... My wife ordered trout as a starter and then halibut as a main course. Both were declared excellent! We had ordered a bottle of St Veran, which was excellent (Joseph Drouhin 2017). She then ordered the plum souffle, which was also lovely (she allowed me a taste), washed down with some dessert wine which was equally good (but whose name eludes me). The service from our Portuguese waiter was the perfect balance of friendliness, humour, authenticity, efficiency and knowledge - although I neglected to ask for his name, he is a credit to the restaurant.", "Now, some 'even better ifs'... it would have been even better if there was a wider selection of vegetarian options. That said, I was happy to order the Gnocchi as it sounded interesting, coming with parmesan waifers and pecan meringue. In the event it rather lacked flavour and I missed the pecan meringue in the dish: when I mentioned this to the maitre d' he pondered the question then claimed that it was included in the gnocchi themselves rather than separate. I found this surprising as there was no evidence to suggest this. In any event, it was somewhat underwhelming. I then ordered treacle tart - a particular favourite - but was informed a few minutes' later that it was no longer available. The waiter suggested the apple dish as an alternative. The apple itself was well-cooked and not too sweet, but the crumble seemed under-cooked. ", "I had ordered the mushroom buckwheat as a main and that was deeply flavoured, with some lovely complexity and a richness that was not overpowering. It was gobbled up with great relish.", "Overall, we very much enjoyed the experience, given all the plus points called out above, but it does disappoint me that vegetarians get a raw deal in terms of choice. I was also not overly wowed by my starter and dessert, which was a shame: to be clear, they were not 'bad' just not up to the same standard of excellence which my wife enjoyed. All the wines we ordered were top notch and the service from our waiter equally good. ", "Would we return? Yes, absolutely - the style of cooking and the ambience was very much to our liking."]}

He also went to the table behind you and was doing the same when there were 4 diners at that table. These diners were about to complain to us and were signalling us when the manager came and suggested that you move to a table away from these diners. At this time only the two of you and your children were at the table and your friends joined you only around 8:30 PM having made a booking for 8:00 PM.

It was pretty decent the first few times and went a bit downhill as years went by. Nevertheless, it was the closest and as we had a 2 year old in our group, did not want to venture far. There were 6 (including the 2 year old) of us and we had booked in advance. We went into the restaurant and were seated by a staff member. We were looking through the menu when the big guy with glasses (who I think is one of the owners) came by and rudely asked us to get up. We were surprised and my husband questioned the need for this, he very abruptly said that he will move the table to a corner as he wanted to rearrange the seating so that he can include seating for 2 people, where we were sitting. We were confused as there was clearly a 2 seater at the corner- but no he wanted the 6 of us to get up so that he can rearrange the table for the white couple (obviously this wasnt mentioned, but we noticed this after we ordered when the couple walked in) who would be coming in soon. We should have got up and left at that moment but the staff member who sat us initially was very apologetic and we ordered. We spend close to 100 pounds in the evening and even paid service charge. I was reluctant but my husband said he would rather pay as that goes to the staff (hopefully!) and he wouldnt fault the staff. The food was mediocre but nothing to complain. It was the whole experience of being ask to rudely get up and move for a white couple, after we had sat down and made ourselves comfortable, that sullied the experience. This was when there was a perfectly good spot for a couple seat at the corner. Furthermore, being racist and rude does not help. We are frequent restaurant goers but we wouldnt be darkening their doors again. I would recommend Mumbai Central at Polhill for excellent service and much better quality food for the same price."]}

Then when mains were delivered & we realised there were no vegetables with them, it became a bit of a battle to get some as we were told the chef was closing the kitchen & wanted to go home!!!", "The final straw was all the lights went on & they opened the doors so the restaurant became very cold. it was quite clear we were wanted to go home.

I was delighted with mouth watering starters which came pretty fast and when the main course came I could smell it before I even saw it come in. It was beautiful from the way it was displayed to how delicious it tasted. The meal was well cooked and the slow music in the background was extremely relaxing. I was mesmerised by how the food was cooked to perfection. They asked if the food was okay and made sure i was happy with the service given. The portion was worth what i paid and i would definitely be going back. This restaurant is a place not to be missed!! Oh and the restaurant looks stunning!

Well, I am so glad my other Italian was booked because we had the most amazing meal. I have to say, all three courses were not just good, they were outstanding. We had a bottle of wine, which was on the menu and was one of our favourites, it just got better and better!

The atmosphere was very appropriate for the occasion, the tables decorated with party hats, streamers and poppers;balloons and coloured lighting added to the effect. There was music and an area of the floor set aside for those who wished to dance with an evocative selection of music to pass the rest of the evening to and Auld Lang Syne at midnight.

The staff were very courteous and nothing was of no bother , very attentive . We started with cocktails and had some pre drinks whilst we looked at their extensive menu , we were with a party of four ( with two of the party that were trained chefs ) . So we cheekily ordered four different dishes as our chefs wanted to taste the textures and flavor . The food was presented well and the tastes were sublime ! We would highly recommend this Italian restaurant , also it was located approximately 5 minutes from Heathrow airport .

The lamb kebabs were dry and far too spicy and the chicken wings were awful.", "Service was spectacularly slow. We ask for a jug of water which took half an hour. Even asking for a coke took ages. The servers seem to 'forget' things and needed constant reminders.

The Mojito was basic, and at \u00a34 probably over priced. Jacket fries were nice and the salad was decent.

The owner is a young humble man who ensures his customers are happy and in one of our visits even packed a portion of beetroot hummus for my little one as he loved it so much. I highly recommend this place to everyone. If you want to try authentic Lebanese food with great friendly staff in a well presented restaurant, this place is for you.

The food is very tasty and they offer a variety of Lebanese dishes. I can recommend the Chicken shish wrap, which comes with fries and salad. We also had hummous, flat bread, pickles. Last time I had the chicken soup as I wasn't that hungry and can honestly say the flavours were home-made and tonnes of chicken. Served with flat bread it was delightful.", "I also like everything is freshly presented. I can be critical of places but the two other comments is that the salad is exceptionally fresh. Also, the toilets in the restaurant are very clean (my way of judging a restaurant lol). If you're in the area I really would recommend this place. 5 star rating it deserves."]}

The sauces, the rice, the sides, all were beautiful, but start of the show? The Peshwari Naan - It was like delicate paper, you could almost see through it and it melted in the mouth. Staff cleared away dishes quickly, without hovering, which is always a bonus, wine was topped up regularly all in all, a wonderful night, with wonderful food and exceptional company (the hubby). Only thing that spoiled it a little was the built-in service charge. We would have tipped generously anyway, but all-in-all, with service charge and leaving our change, the 'tip' came to \u00a330.00 which is expensive (I feel), and the meal itself was \u00a3150 or something and that was with discount of a smartbox voucher (\u00a360.00)...although I would say, we did go 'off piste'. We could have had the set menu, but thought as we were there, might as well go the whole hog! Anyway, a little expensive, but overall, absolutely beautiful.
